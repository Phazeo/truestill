# Truestill

Categorize and date-organize a photo and video library into a stable, browsable tree.
Audio files (voice memos, `.m4a`/`.mp3`/`.amr` and friends) are recognized, organized and
counted alongside them, but photos and videos are what Truestill is built and tuned for:

```
<destination>/
├── 2025/
│   ├── 2025-08/
│   │   ├── 2025-08 - Everyday/      <- ordinary photos from that month
│   │   └── 2025-08-14 - Goa Trip/   <- a named event, if you name one
│   └── 2025-09/
├── Screenshots/2026/2026-07/        <- non-camera sources sit beside the years
├── WhatsApp/2025/2025-08/
├── Snapseed/2023/2023-05/           <- created on the fly, no code change
└── Undated/                         <- no trustworthy date; never guessed
```

**Your years are the top level.** A photo library is a timeline first and a set of sources
second, so the year is the parent and months name themselves - `2025-08`, not a bare `08`, so a
folder still says what it is once it is copied, searched or attached somewhere on its own.
Screenshots, WhatsApp images and other non-camera sources are filed *beside* the years rather
than above them, so they never break the timeline apart.

Built for organizing a Google Photos export before it is pushed to long-term storage,
but nothing in it is Google-specific.

## The folder set is not hard-coded

Labels are **derived from each file's own evidence**, not chosen from a fixed list. A
library containing Signal, Snapseed, a flatbed scanner or a camera brand the tool has
never seen grows those folders by itself. Files whose origin cannot be proven land in
`Saved` - named that, and not `Unsorted`, because to a normal user "unsorted" reads as a
failure when these are genuinely just images saved from apps or the web, whose origin is
unknowable by design (platforms strip EXIF on upload).

## How a file is classified

Rules run in priority order and the **first** match wins:

| # | Rule | Evidence | Confidence |
|---|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | `screenshot_metadata` | Vendor tag, e.g. `SamsungCaptureInfo=Screenshot` | high |
| 2 | `screenshot_name` | `Screenshot_*`, `Screen Shot *`, `Screenshot from *` | medium |
| 3 | `filename_convention` | Extensible table: WhatsApp `-WA<n>`, Telegram (2 conventions), Signal, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Viber, WeChat, Discord, Line, … | medium |
| 4 | `software` | `Software` tag naming an application → folder named after it | low |
| 5 | `device` | `Make` + `Model` (or video `SamsungModel`) → `Camera`, or the device itself with `--by-device` | medium |
| 6 | `fallback` | nothing matched → `Saved` | low |

Order is load-bearing. Screenshots are checked **before** device metadata because a
screenshot often also carries `Make`/`Model` and would otherwise be filed as a camera
photo. Messenger filenames are checked before device metadata for the same reason:
WhatsApp strips most metadata, so the filename stamp is the more reliable signal of
where a file actually came from.

Adding a new source means adding one row to `NAME_PATTERNS` in `categorize.py`.

## How the date is chosen

1. **Embedded metadata** - `DateTimeOriginal`, then `CreateDate`, `MediaCreateDate`,
   `TrackCreateDate` (covers both photos and video containers).
2. **Filename convention** - `YYYYMMDD`, `YYYY-MM-DD`, or Telegram Desktop's
   `DD-MM-YYYY`. These are **flagged for manual review** in the report; a date parsed
   from a filename is a convention, not a guarantee.
3. **Nothing** - the file goes to `<Label>/Undated/`. Dates are never guessed.

**Filesystem mtime is never consulted.** Google Photos downloads and Takeout zips carry
the *download* time in the filesystem timestamp, so trusting mtime would file an entire
library under the day it was exported.

## Timestamps

After placing a file, its mtime/atime are set from the resolved capture date -
equivalent in intent to:

```bash
exiftool "-FileModifyDate<DateTimeOriginal" -r <folder>
```

but driven by the *same* date used for folder placement, so a file's mtime and its
year/month folder can never disagree. Disable with `--no-timestamps`.

## More than organizing

Organizing is the entry point, not the whole tool. Truestill also owns the **custody - a verified
record of where every file is safe** for the library it builds:

- **De-duplication**, two tiers - exact (SHA-256) skipped, perceptual look-alikes kept and
  *flagged*, so an original is never silently dropped for a resembling file.
- **Archive and folder rescue** (`truestill ingest --source`) - reads a folder of photos or the
  archives a service gave you (`.zip`, `.tar`, `.tgz`), and recovers the capture dates that
  survive only in the export's JSON sidecars, and bakes them losslessly into the organized
  copy. The source is never modified.
- **Drive identity and an offline catalog** - which drive holds which copy, answerable with
  the drive unplugged (`truestill where`).
- **Verification and 3-2-1 backup** - re-hash a connected drive against the catalog
  (`truestill verify`), copy the library to a second drive, and see what still exists in only
  one place (`truestill status`).
- **Configurable layout** with crash-safe migration of an existing library.
- **Trips & events** - opt-in clustering that proposes named events for you to confirm; never
  auto-named.
- **Space-safe relocation**, all opt-in and verify-gated: `--move`, `--in-place` (moves by
  rename rather than copying, with `truestill undo-organize` to reverse it), and
  `truestill reclaim`.

There is also **`truestill-app`**, a local web UI on `127.0.0.1` - token-authenticated,
server-rendered, with a React island for the Organize result. It is co-equal with the CLI, not a replacement: both
front-ends call the same core library.

## Requirements for working from a clone

⚠ **Not needed to run a release.** The downloads carry their own Python and their own `exiftool`
- see [Install](#install). This section is for building or developing from the source tree.


- Python ≥ 3.14, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- `exiftool` - the only tool that reads photo EXIF, video container tags and vendor
  MakerNotes through one interface:

```bash
sudo apt install -y libimage-exiftool-perl
```

Runtime Python dependencies are deliberately minimal and each is justified in writing
(`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §7). The core's are `platformdirs`, `imagehash`,
`numpy`, `pillow`, `pillow-heif` and `send2trash` (perceptual hashing needs image decoding,
which the stdlib cannot do); the app adds `starlette` + `uvicorn`. The CLI adds none. **The list
is the claim - there is deliberately no count beside it**, because a count and a list go stale
independently and only the list says which one is wrong. `[project.dependencies]` in each
`pyproject.toml` is the source.
Hashing, SQLite, concurrency and all path/date work are stdlib. The browser lane additionally
needs Node; `make check` does not.

⚠ **Running the app from a clone needs the React bundle**, which is gitignored and built by
Vite: `make frontend-install && make frontend` (Node 24.16.0, pinned by `.nvmrc`). Without it the
page loads `/static/dist/main.js`, gets a 404, and the Organize result region renders nothing;
`truestill-app --self-check` names the two missing files.

## Working on a mounted or cloud filesystem

Truestill runs against a mounted drive or a cloud filesystem (an rclone remote, a NAS, a sync client's mount) as
happily as a local disk, and **the cheap answers stay cheap wherever the files live**:
`truestill analyze` censused 32,628 files in 21 seconds over a cloud mount, because a census
reads folder listings rather than the files themselves.

**The expensive answers scale with your connection, not with your computer.** Finding duplicates
or checking dates has to read the file contents. On one encrypted cloud mount that meant
29.4 GB at about 9 MB/s - roughly 53 minutes - with the CPU 3% busy the whole time, so the wait
is the link and not the work. **Encryption is a cost of its own on top of that**: client-side encryption
decrypts on your machine, so every byte goes through their client as well as over the wire.

One mount on one connection - yours will differ, and Truestill deliberately does not guess a
finishing time from it (`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §5.2 says why). It tells you how much it needs to
read before it starts, so the decision is yours.

## Install

### From a release (most people)

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/dinesh-ad/truestill/releases) - **Windows** the
`TruestillSetup-*.exe`, **Linux** the `truestill_*_amd64.deb`, or the portable archive on either
if you would rather not install:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i truestill_*_amd64.deb        # Linux
```

**Nothing else is needed** - no Python, no `uv`, no `exiftool`: the builds carry their own.
Verify the download first, see [Verifying a download](#verifying-a-download).

⚠ **Windows shows a SmartScreen warning** when you launch the installer, before anything is
installed: these builds are not code-signed (`docs/DECISIONS.md` D9). Choose **More info** then
**Run anyway**. **macOS is not published** - Gatekeeper refuses unsigned applications outright.

### From a clone (development)

```bash
make install       # uv sync --all-packages --group dev
```

## Verifying a download

Release archives are built by CI from a tagged commit and the checksums file is **signed with
[sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)** - keyless, so there is no certificate to trust and no key
for anyone to steal. The signature proves the artifact came from this repository's own workflow.

```bash
# 1. the file you downloaded matches the published checksums
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS

# 2. those checksums were produced by this repository's release workflow
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/dinesh-ad/truestill/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  SHA256SUMS
```

`cosign` is [Sigstore's own tool](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). Both commands must succeed:
the first says the bytes are intact, the second says where they came from.

⚠ **The SmartScreen warning is described once, under [Install](#from-a-release-most-people).**
It said *"on first run"* here and *"when you launch the installer"* there - **two copies of one
fact, and they had already drifted.** The installer warns first, which is the earlier and more
alarming moment, so that is the one a page must predict accurately: `docs/DECISIONS.md` D9 rests
on the prediction being right, not merely present.

## Usage

The CLI is subcommand-based. **Dry run is the default** - nothing is written without
`--apply`. A dry run explains **every file** - where it would go, which date it used and why -
because that is what you read before deciding. A run you have already authorised with `--apply`
shows the counts instead and writes the per-file detail to `last-run.json` beside your catalog,
so you can still find out later which photos failed:

```bash
truestill analyze <folder>    # what is in here? -- reads nothing, changes nothing

truestill organize <source> <destination>
truestill organize <source> <destination> --apply --report reports/run.json
truestill organize <source> <destination> --apply

truestill-app                 # the local web UI
```

⚠ **These are the commands an installed copy answers to** - the packages put **both**
`truestill` (this CLI) and `truestill-app` (the web UI) on your `PATH`. **Working from a clone,
prefix every one with `uv run`.**

⚠ **THE CLI WAS ABSENT FROM EVERY RELEASE UNTIL 2026-09-15, AND THIS PARAGRAPH SAID OTHERWISE.**
The lane froze the app alone and named the result `truestill`, so the binary you got was the web
UI wearing this one's name: `truestill analyze` exited 2 with *"unrecognized arguments"*, and so
did `organize`, `verify`, `account` and `self-check`. Six capabilities with no other home -
`reclaim`, `rescan`, `repoint-sources`, `carried`, `self-check`, `catalog --move` - were
**unreachable** rather than merely CLI-only. It is fixed by `(akv)`: two executables from one
PyInstaller `COLLECT`, and `packaging/build_deb.py:verify_bundle_binaries` now refuses a package
missing either, so it cannot go missing quietly again.

**Start with `analyze`** if you have not used Truestill before. It needs only a folder - no
destination, no library, no setup. ⚠ **The product says this too since 2026-09-16**: typing
`truestill` on its own prints a short first screen with these same three commands on it, rather
than the argparse error and the one-line list of 23 subcommands it used to give. The screen is
pinned to the parser and to the commands themselves by
`test_the_first_screen_only_promises_what_the_product_does.py`, which **runs** each example - so
this paragraph and that screen cannot recommend different things.

**The count, size, photo / video / audio split and every format it found appear in about a
second**, from file names and sizes alone. It then tells you what it is about to do and roughly
what it will cost - *"checking for identical copies, needs to read 12 GB of your 192 GB"* - and
goes on to work out the **date range** of your photos and how much space **identical copies**
are wasting. Press Ctrl-C at any point and everything already on screen is yours to keep.

The one thing it does not do is look for **look-alikes** - the same photo at a different size or
quality - because that means decoding every image, which is far slower. It says so rather than
reporting a zero.

`truestill --help` lists every subcommand: `analyze`, `organize`, `ingest`, `drives`,
`repoint-sources`, `undo-organize`, `where`, `verify`, `status`, `catalog`, `config`,
`reclaim`, `migrate-layout`, `backup`, `bake`, `rename`, `clean-empty`, `rescan`, `restore`,
`carried`, `recover`, `self-check`, `account`.

⚠ Two of those were missing until 2026-08-30. The list is pinned by
`test_the_readme_names_every_subcommand.py`, which reads the parser rather than this sentence -
and which is deliberately kept out of the paragraph above, because a note naming the very
subcommands it is about would satisfy the guard on behalf of a list that had lost them.

Frequently used `organize` flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--apply` | Actually write files. Without it, nothing is touched. |
| `--move` | Move instead of copy. Default is copy, leaving the source intact. |
| `--in-place` | Reorganize in this same folder by rename, so no second copy is needed and nothing is rewritten. Use this when you do not have space for a full copy. Reversible with `truestill undo-organize` - which is also what covers a power cut on a FAT32 or exFAT drive, since those cannot make a rename crash-safe. |
| `--by-device` | Name capture folders after the device (`samsung SM-A546B`) instead of `Camera`. |
| `--events` | Propose named events for camera clusters (you name or skip them). |
| `--skip-undated` | Skip undateable files instead of copying them to `Undated/`. |
| `--all-files` | Include non-media extensions. |
| `--no-rename` | Do not add the `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_` prefix to copies. |
| `--no-timestamps` | Do not set mtime from the capture date. |
| `--report PATH` | Write this run's record here instead of beside the catalog. Every applied run writes one either way. |

## Safety

- **Dry run by default** - `--apply` is the only thing that writes. A read never writes.
- **Copy, not move, by default** - the source tree survives a bad run. The three exceptions
  (`--move`, `--in-place`, `reclaim`) are each opt-in, individually confirmed, and never
  remove a source without proof that the content survives.
- **Never overwrites.** On a name collision the file is hashed: identical content is
  reported as a duplicate and skipped; different content is written alongside with a
  `_1` suffix.
- **Dates are never invented.** No date evidence means `Undated/`.
- **Nothing is silently dropped.** Skipped, refused and unverifiable outcomes are counted and
  named in the report - never folded into a success total.
- **Your photos never leave your machine.** No telemetry, and nothing about your library is
  ever transmitted (`docs/DECISIONS.md` D5).

## How the repository is laid out

Three packages in a [uv workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/), one
lockfile at the root:

| package | what it is | open it when you are changing |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/truestill-core` | the library, and everything safety-critical: dating, dedup, layout, the catalog, custody | behaviour - what Truestill decides and what it writes |
| `packages/truestill-cli` | the `truestill` command | the terminal surface: flags, prompts, printed output |
| `packages/truestill-app` | `truestill-app`, the local web UI | the browser surface: screens, wording, what a person clicks |

Each surface depends on **core** and never on the other, so a decision lives in one place and
both surfaces read it. If a change would need editing two packages, it usually belongs in core.

Tests sit beside their package. **The browser suite is separate** - `tests/e2e`, run by
`make e2e` - because it needs a real browser download, and `make check` must stay green on a
fresh clone without one. It exists to catch a class of defect the other layers cannot see: the
product describing itself incorrectly on screen.

## Development

```bash
make check         # lint + format-check + typecheck + prose/name/artifact gates + test
make lint
make format
make typecheck
make test

make e2e-install   # once: fetch the chromium and webkit builds
make e2e           # browser end-to-end suite (opt-in; not part of `make check`)
```

`make check` is green on a fresh clone with no browser installed - the E2E layer is
deliberately opt-in.
