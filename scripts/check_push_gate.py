"""Refuse a push while a run is in flight on the branch, or the tip being pushed onto is red.

**The rule this makes executable, and the distinction that made it fail twice.**
`ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` §2 rules that *"a pending result outranks a ready batch"*, written after
three cancelled runs in one session. That sentence carries **two** obligations:

* **CONTENTION** - do not push while a run is in flight, because `ci.yml` sets
  `cancel-in-progress: true` and the push kills it. Measured: 6 of 40 runs ended `cancelled`.
* **OUTCOME** - do not push onto a tip whose run is red, or the next run stops being a readable
  signal about its own commit.

The first failure was that only contention was honoured. The second, `(agn)`, is that the two were
separated **in prose and conflated in code**:

⚠ **THEY HAVE DIFFERENT KEYS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FIX.** Contention is a question about the
**branch** - *any* live push run on the ref dies, whatever commit it is for. Outcome is a question
about **one specific commit** - the tip the remote actually has. The old implementation answered
both from a single sha it derived with ``git rev-parse @{upstream}``, then scanned the fifteen most
recent runs and sieved them locally. Three ways that is wrong:

* ``@{upstream}`` is the **local remote-tracking cache**. Somebody else's push, or simply not
  having fetched, made it ask about a commit the remote no longer had.
* a red tip whose run had aged out of a fifteen-run window read as *no evidence of a failure*.
* a run in flight for a **different** sha on the branch was invisible, and the push cancelled it.

🔑 **git hands the answer over, and the gate did not take it.** `githooks(5)` specifies that
``pre-push`` receives ``<local ref> SP <local sha1> SP <remote ref> SP <remote sha1> LF`` per ref
on **stdin**. The remote tip is a given, not something to infer, and this file previously contained
no reference to stdin at all.

**It refuses; it never waits.** A hook that blocked for eleven minutes would be bypassed with
`--no-verify` the first afternoon, which is worse than an honest refusal - the same reasoning
`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §6.1 records for not making `make gate` a blocking hook.

⚠ **CANNOT-ASK AND ASKED-AND-NOTHING ARE DIFFERENT, and only the first fails open - at the
PREFLIGHT.** Without `gh`, without auth, or with the API unreachable, the gate cannot see its
subject and says so - because a gate that blocks every push on a plane or a fresh clone gets
uninstalled, taking its real coverage with it. ⚠ **AFTER a preflight that answered, cannot-ask
FAILS CLOSED (P189, 2026-09-02).** Until then a transient failure on the very next call returned
``None`` and ``None`` meant *no refusal*, so a red tip passed with no message the moment the
network blinked once. Now every call is retried (`GH_ATTEMPTS`, `GH_RETRY_PAUSE_SECONDS`), a
blip survives the retry, and a persistent outage refuses with the override named - a decision
the person makes, not a pass the gate hands out. But a tip with **no run** is not that: `ci.yml` has no `paths` filter on
``push: branches: [main]``, so every push to main creates one. Absent is therefore unknown, and
unknown is not green - the shape `(afl)` keeps finding.

⚠ **THE TRANSPORT IS PART OF THE GATE, AND IT WAS SILENTLY MISSING FOR A DAY (P33).** From
`a173c42` to `1d5a...`'s fix, this file was correct and INERT: pre-commit's `hook-impl` consumes
git's pre-push stdin and forwards **nothing** - observed 2026-08-23 with a probe hook printing
``stdin:[]`` - so the gate saw no refs, exited 0 through the not-gated branch, and pre-commit
suppressed the warning under ``Passed``. Two pushes were "allowed" that were never judged, one of
them onto a RED tip. What pre-commit sets instead, **observed rather than read off its docs**:
``PRE_COMMIT_FROM_REF`` = the sha of the REMOTE tip being pushed onto, ``PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF`` =
the local sha, ``PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_BRANCH`` = the ref name. And for a brand-new branch (zero
remote sha) `hook-impl` runs **no pre-push hooks at all**, so the env transport never carries a
new-branch push - the zero-sha filtering below serves direct git installs only. The stdin
protocol stays first because it is githooks(5) truth and carries multi-ref pushes; the env is
the fallback for the one harness that actually runs this file.

⚠ **A MESSAGE THAT MATTERS MUST RIDE A NON-ZERO EXIT.** pre-commit shows a passing hook's name
and ``Passed`` and swallows everything it printed. That suppression has now cost twice - the
override's report in `(agn)`, and this gate's own "NOT gated" confession above - so the
no-subject case FAILS CLOSED: unknown is not green, and a warning nobody can see is not a
warning. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` carries the same constraint where the hooks are defined.

⚠ **EVERY VERDICT NAMES ITS SUBJECT**, including the override. On 2026-08-23 a push passed while
the remote tip was red and the only visible line was this hook's *name* followed by `Passed`: the
override had fired and pre-commit had suppressed its message, so nothing on screen said which
commit had been judged, or that nothing had been. A verdict that does not name its subject cannot
be checked by the person reading it.
