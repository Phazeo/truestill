"""Build the Linux `.deb` around the PyInstaller one-folder output.

**Why a `.deb` and not an AppImage or a tarball** (`BACKLOG.md` `(aad)`): it is the shape a Linux
user's own tooling installs, upgrades and removes, and the only one of the three that registers
with the system at all. AppImage was declined - its viability turns on a plugin, and Briefcase's
own maintainers discourage their AppImage backend.

**Layout follows the FHS**, which is what a `.deb` is for:

* ``/usr/lib/truestill/`` - the frozen application, one folder, exactly as PyInstaller built it;
* ``/usr/bin/truestill`` - a relative symlink onto it, so the command is on PATH;
* ``/usr/share/applications/`` - a desktop entry, because this is a double-clicked app rather
  than a daemon;
* ``/usr/share/icons/hicolor/<N>x<N>/apps/truestill.png`` - the mark, at eight sizes;
* ``/usr/share/doc/truestill/copyright`` - what the bundle carries and under what terms.

**Depends: perl.** We vendor exiftool's *modules*; we do not vendor an *interpreter*. exiftool's
floor is ``require 5.004`` and every distribution ships far beyond it, but declaring it is what
makes the package honest rather than lucky - and the self-check proves it at runtime rather than
assuming, reporting a missing interpreter differently from a broken bundle.

**Depends: hicolor-icon-theme, FOR THE TRIGGER RATHER THAN FOR ITS ICONS.** We use none of its
artwork. What we need is the *file trigger* it registers on ``/usr/share/icons/hicolor``, which is
what refreshes the icon cache after our PNGs land; with the package absent, no trigger exists and
the cache is never rebuilt. Verified rather than assumed, two ways. dpkg's own specification
(``/usr/share/doc/dpkg/spec/triggers.txt``) says file triggers *"are activated automatically by
dpkg when a matching file is installed, upgraded or removed as part of a package"* and are named
by absolute path, *"activated when the specified filesystem object, or any object under the
specified subdirectory, is created, updated or deleted by dpkg during package unpack or removal"*.
So **no maintainer script of ours is needed, and none is added** - the activation is dpkg's, from
what dpkg itself unpacks, which is equally true of ``dpkg -i`` on a local file as of apt.
Observed on a real machine: ``hicolor-icon-theme`` is registered ``interest-noawait
/usr/share/icons/hicolor``, declares no triggers of its own in the *triggering* package, and went
``triggers-pending`` during the **unpack** of a package that merely ships icons - before that
package's own configure ran.

**The icon name in the desktop entry carries no extension**, and that is the specification rather
than a style: the Icon Theme Specification's lookup appends ``.png``/``.svg``/``.xpm`` itself, so
``Icon=truestill.png`` would be searched for as ``truestill.png.png``. Debian Policy §9.6 wants
*"a PNG or SVG icon with a transparent background, providing at least the 22x22 size, and
preferably up to 64x64"*; the eight sizes below clear both ends, and the transparency is asserted
on the **staged bytes** by ``verify_icon.py`` rather than trusted.

**No ``scalable/apps/truestill.svg``, deliberately.** ``brand/`` holds the mark as SVG, but as
*two* drawings: ``build_brand_assets.py`` renders the fluted variant at 128px and above and the
flute-less one below, because the hairline is sub-pixel at small sizes. A scalable entry can be
preferred over a fixed size by the lookup, so shipping one would silently override that split with
whichever variant we picked - a third drawing that can disagree with the eight PNGs. The PNGs are
the mark here.

⚠ **On vendoring, since a Debian-literate user will notice.** Debian Policy §4.13 says *"Debian
packages should not make use of these convenience copies unless the included package is explicitly
intended to be used in this way"*. It **discourages rather than forbids**, it binds packages **in
the Debian archive** - which this is not, it is served from our own site - and the exception clause
fits almost verbatim: exiftool's own README documents running the script with its `lib/` beside it
precisely so it need not be installed. Recorded here so we can say this before someone says it to
us, and so that anyone who later wants this *in* Debian knows the one conversation they will have.
