# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to adhere to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

The first release with **licensing**, and the release where organizing stops being the only thing
Truestill can do for you: photographs can now come **back** off a drive, a Google Takeout rescue
can be **applied** rather than only previewed, and a copy the product has proven is corrupt stops
being counted as somewhere your photograph lives.

Every screen has been redrawn.

### Added

- **The command line is in the packages.** Until now the releases contained the web UI only, and
  the `truestill` they put on your `PATH` was that UI under the CLI's name, so the commands in
  the Usage section - `analyze`, `organize`, `verify` and the rest - answered *"unrecognized
  arguments"* on an installed copy. Six features had no other way in at all:
  `reclaim`, `rescan`, `repoint-sources`, `carried`, `self-check` and `catalog --move`. The
  packages now install **both** `truestill` (the command line) and `truestill-app` (the web UI),
  on Windows and on Linux. On Windows the installer puts them on your `PATH` and takes that entry
  away again when you uninstall.
- **Bring photographs back from a drive.** Until now a backup drive was somewhere files went.
  `truestill recover`, and *Bring these back* on the drive card, fill gaps in your library from a
  drive that has them - comparing content, never overwriting, and never touching a file that is
  already right. `truestill carried` says what a drive is holding that this computer is not.
- **Apply a Google Takeout rescue.** The Import screen could show you what a Takeout export held
  and then leave you to the command line. It can now do it, behind a typed confirmation, and it
  cleans up the unpacked copy after itself.
- **Every screen that names a drive says whether it is plugged in.** Previously you had to
  remember which of your drives was connected, on screens that listed all of them alike.
- **A copy proven corrupt is recorded as corrupt.** `verify` could read a photograph, find its
  bytes wrong, tell you "1 changed" - and write nothing down, so the next screen still counted
  that copy as a place your photograph lived. It is now recorded, your custody counts exclude it,
  and `recover` refuses to pull from it.
- **Licensing, and a free tier that is a volume cap rather than a crippled product.** The first
  1,000 files you organize are free, cumulatively; everything else - finding, browsing, verifying,
  checking where things are - stays unlimited and always will. A licence is a file you save and
  use; there is no account, no sign-in, and nothing phones home. A lapsed licence keeps every
  version it paid for.
- **`truestill account`** shows which licence this installation holds, and `--use-file` installs
  one. `truestill self-check` now names it too, without printing anything personal - it is a
  report designed to be pasted into a bug report.
- **Typing `truestill` on its own tells you where to start.** It used to answer with an error
  and a list of 23 commands wrapped onto one line. It now says what the product does, gives you
  three things to try - look at a folder, see what a run would do, do it - and points at
  `--help` for the rest.

### Changed

- **Git hooks run with prek**, a drop-in for pre-commit (same `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; install with `uv run prek install`). `virtualenv` and `filelock` leave `uv.lock` with it, 20 of the dependency audit's advisories. The push gate's tests drive `prek hook-impl`, and prek hands the gate the same `PRE_COMMIT_*` variables.

- **The whole interface has been redrawn.** A warm canvas, a single dark rail, one accent colour,
  and a type scale cut from eight sizes to six. The Organize screen is rebuilt around a stepper
  that says where you are, one card instead of four, counts that stay put while you read them,
  and a button that stops moving under the pointer.
- **Every clickable thing is at least 24x24 pixels**, which is WCAG 2.2's floor, measured in a
  real browser rather than asserted.
- **The Organize preview shows what your library will actually look like**, per destination,
  instead of a summary you had to interpret.

### Fixed

- **Searching for two words works.** `2014 IMG` matched nothing at all, because the whole phrase
  was treated as one literal piece of text. Each word is now matched separately and order does not
  matter.
- **Settings shows the version you are running.** Every published build called itself
  *"unknown (not installed)"* on its own Settings screen, so the one place you would look to
  report a bug could not tell you what you had.
- **The Drives screen opens quickly on a large library.** It was sending every at-risk file to a
  screen that shows three of them - about 18 MB of names at 300,000 files. The count is still
  exact; only the names are capped.
- **`verify` reads the disk, not memory.** It could confirm a file it had just written by reading
  it back out of the operating system's cache, which proves nothing about what is on the drive.
- **A licensed run no longer spends your free allowance.** Runs made with a licence were still
  counted against the free 1,000. Nothing looked wrong at the time - but if you ever lost the
  licence file, you were left with nothing, having paid.
- **Organizing to a second destination previews correctly**, instead of reusing the first
  destination's answer.
- **Changing a setting clears the result it produced**, rather than leaving an answer on screen
  that no longer describes what you asked for.
- **Truestill will not overwrite a photograph it recognises.** When a run repairs a file that an
  interrupted copy left broken, it writes over the broken one - which is right. It now checks
  first: if the file sitting there is a photograph your library knows about, it is kept, the new
  copy is placed beside it, and the run tells you which file it left alone.
- **On Windows and Mac, a photo whose name changed case is still the same photo.** Those
  filesystems treat `Photo.JPG` and `photo.jpg` as one file; Truestill did not. `truestill rescan`
  reported every such file as having moved, exited with an error, and re-read every one of them
  from disk to work out they had not - which on a large library is hours. It now asks the drive
  whether two spellings are one file and answers accordingly. On Linux, where they really are two
  files, nothing changes.
- **`analyze` no longer suggests a command that does not work.** It ended by offering
  `truestill organize <folder> --destination <folder>`, and copying that gave an error. The
  backup advice had the same problem, suggesting `truestill verify` without the folder it needs.
- **The destination tree is a tree on Windows**, not a flat list.
- **Two spellings of one folder are one folder** in the three places that decide something.
- **A long email address wraps at the `@` or the dot** in the account panel, instead of breaking
  mid-word.
- **A very large run no longer builds its whole record in memory** before writing it.
- **The free-files count is right the moment a run ends.** The rail showed the count as it stood
  when you opened the page, so after organizing 100 photos it still read *"700 of 1,000 left"*
  while 600 were left. It is refreshed when a run finishes - not while one is going, because a
  counter ticking down beside your photographs is not something this product does.
- **Truestill tells you when it upgrades your library catalog.** Opening your library with a
  newer version can change the catalog's format in place, and nothing said so. It now says it, in
  the terminal and in the app, naming the version it came from, the version it is on, and the
  thing that matters: an older Truestill will no longer open it. It also tells you where the copy
  of the old one is kept - and `truestill catalog` now names that copy too, which it had always
  been described as doing and never did.
- **A photo dated before 1900 says so.** Its date was refused and the file was filed under
  *Undated*, correctly - but the run summary printed a bare `rejected_early` and no explanation,
  and the Import report did not count it in any date row at all. Both now say what was refused
  and why, the way the placeholder and future-dated cases always have.

### A note on how this file is written

⚠ **A commit that changes what a user sees gets a line here. Most commits do not.** The twenty
lines above stand for every commit in this release a customer would notice. The rest - the large
majority - are tests, guards, refactors, CI, measurement and documentation: real work, and not
news to someone deciding whether to upgrade. Count the release rather than trusting a number
here, which is the same rule the rest of this repository's prose follows:

```sh
git log --oneline v0.1.1..HEAD | wc -l
``` Keep a Changelog's own tagline is the rule: *"don't let your friends dump git logs
into changelogs."* Commit messages here are engineering prose written for the next engineer, and
they are right to be; this file is written for the person running the product, from the outside
in, describing **what they gained** rather than what moved.

**Nothing enforces this**, deliberately. A guard would have to decide whether a diff changes what
a user sees, which no test can answer - the same reasoning `docs/BACKLOG.md` `(ajk)` records for
quoting evidence. The practice is written down instead, which is what makes it checkable by a
person at release time: read the log, and for each commit ask whether a customer would notice.


## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-03

A patch release. **If you have 0.1.0, take this one before organizing anything.**

### Fixed

- **The Organize screen shows its results again.** The 0.1.0 downloads shipped without the file
  that draws the Organize result: *Look inside* ran and the run button appeared, but the preview,
  the completion card and every error message on that screen stayed blank. The release now packs
  that file and checks for it before publishing; the other six screens were never affected.
- **Cancelling a run no longer shows "Something went wrong".** Every accepted cancel painted a red
  banner, and a cancel clicked in the first instant of an unpack was silently lost - the progress
  bar kept counting with no result behind it. Cancel is honoured whenever it is clicked, and the
  screen says so.
- **`verify` no longer calls a file lost because you tidied it.** If a photograph is not where the
  catalog recorded it, Truestill now looks for the same bytes elsewhere on the drive before saying
  anything, and reports **moved, not lost** with the place it found it. A file that really is gone
  still reads as gone and still exits non-zero - the two are different facts with different
  remedies. The search runs only when something is missing, so a clean check costs what it always
  did.
- **A second copy on the same device is no longer counted as redundancy.** `reclaim` will not
  delete your originals on the strength of a copy it cannot show is independent, `status` says so
  in plain words, and the Backups, Stats and drive cards agree with it. Truestill can prove two
  copies share a device and can never prove they do not, so the third answer - *we cannot tell* -
  is reported rather than guessed.
- **Album membership survives moving to another machine.** Albums used to travel as a list of
  names with nothing in them; the drive's document now carries which photographs are in each album,
  by content. A photograph the new library has not seen yet is kept in the document and counted,
  not dropped - plug in the drive that holds it, scan, and restore again.
- A backup that stops now tells you what landed instead of printing a traceback, and a run that
  finishes with failures no longer reports itself as simply "done".

### Added

- **Rename a trip or an event**, from the CLI: `truestill rename trip <id> "<new name>"`
  (`--apply` to carry it out; without it you see what would move). A name is what the folder is
  called on the drive, so a rename moves the photographs - and the name changes **last**, after
  every one of them has arrived. An interrupted rename leaves the old name over a folder that is
  partly moved, which is the truth, and the next rename or migration finishes it.
- The drive's own decisions document now takes the new name, so a library rebuilt from the drive
  comes back with what you called things. A name changed on **another machine** is still not
  overwritten.
- **Renaming from the app**, on the Trips & events card that shows the name. It previews first -
  which folder becomes which, and how many photographs move - and only then offers to do it;
  changing the name again withdraws the offer until you look at it. The card used to say
  "renaming is not available here".

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-30

The first published release. Windows and Linux, unsigned (`docs/DECISIONS.md` D9).

### Added

- **Organize a folder of photos and videos into dated folders**, by the date the camera recorded
  rather than by the file's timestamp. Truestill reads EXIF and the formats phones and cameras
  actually write; where there is no date it says so instead of guessing.
- **Nothing is moved until you say so.** Every run previews first, names what it will do, and
  writes only with `--apply`. Your originals are copied, never modified.
- **Identical files are found by content**, so the same photograph saved in four places is
  organized once and the other three are skipped.
- **Look-alikes are found too** - a resized export, or a copy whose metadata was stripped by a
  messaging app - and are kept and flagged rather than silently dropped.
- **A catalog of what is where**, so you can ask which drives hold a photograph, and check that
  the copies are still there and still correct (`verify`).
- **Back up a library to a second drive**, and see which files exist on only one.
- **Undo** an in-place reorganize, putting every file back where it was.
- **A local web interface** (`truestill-app`) beside the command line. Nothing leaves the machine.
- **Runs are recorded**: a permanent one-line history beside your catalog, with file-by-file
  detail for recent runs, so a run that stopped early can be accounted for afterwards.
- **Downloads are verifiable.** `SHA256SUMS` is signed with sigstore, keyless - see
  *Verifying a download* in [`README.md`](README.md).

## Development before the first release

⚠ **These entries are kept as a record and are NOT part of 0.1.0's changes.** They describe work
done before anything was published - including fixes to defects no user could have met, because
there was no previous release to meet them in. They are retained because they explain why the
product behaves as it does; read them as history, not as *what changed for you*.

### Added
- **Undoing an organize now writes down what it put back**, the way organizing itself does - and
  it no longer overwrites the record of the run it reversed. Truestill keeps a permanent one-line
  history of every run beside your catalog, with the full file-by-file detail of recent ones.

### Fixed
- **Internal: paths are now compared in one form everywhere.** Nothing user-visible changed. Two
  builds in two days went red only on Windows because test code compared a path spelled with
  backslashes against the forward-slash form Truestill stores in your catalog, so a drive stays
  readable whichever kind of computer you plug it into. A check now catches that on every
  machine instead of only after a push.

- **A photo whose name is too long is now named and skipped, instead of failing with a message
  nobody could act on.** Truestill copies each photo through a temporary file whose name is
  longer than the finished one, so a name that looked comfortably short could still fail - and
  what you saw was the operating system's own words, run together with a claim about leftover
  bytes that were never written. Truestill now checks before it copies, tells you which photo,
  how many bytes too long it is, and that shortening the name will fix it. The preview reports
  it too, so you find out before anything is written rather than part-way through a run. Your
  original file is never renamed or altered.

- **A run that stops early now tells you what it managed before it stopped.** If the drive filled
  up or stopped accepting files part-way through, Truestill printed the number of photos it had
  *planned* to organize, one line saying what went wrong, and nothing else - so a run that
  organized 37 of 40 photos and then hit a full disk looked, on screen, exactly like one that
  organized all 40. It now prints what actually happened, including how many files it never got
  to. The detail was always being written to your run history; it just never reached the screen.
- **The plan and the result are no longer easy to mistake for each other.** Under `--apply` the
  block of counts printed before a run now says it is the plan and points at the results below it,
  and it states how many files the run will actually organize - which, with *skip files with no
  date* turned on, is fewer than the number of new photos found.
- **A photo the drive accepted is now always written into your catalog.** If the drive took the
  file but refused to set its timestamp - shared folders, a NAS, and phone-style mounts all do
  this - Truestill reported the photo as failed and never recorded it, so the copy sitting on your
  drive was one it had no memory of. The next run could not recognise it and wrote a *second*
  copy beside it, then a third: three photos became nine across three runs, and the last run
  reported success. The copy is now kept, recorded, and named as one whose timestamp could not be
  set. A copy that is genuinely not on the drive is still reported as a failure.
- **Photos organized onto a network drive are no longer thrown away.** On a shared folder, a NAS,
  a phone-style mount or a memory stick formatted FAT32, the drive can take the file but refuse to
  set its timestamp. Truestill could not tell that apart from a copy that failed halfway, so it
  deleted the photo it had just written in full, said *"the drive is read-only"* about a drive that
  had plainly just accepted it - and did the same to every remaining file, because the refusal
  belongs to the drive rather than the file. It now keeps the copy, says which files could not
  have their timestamps set, and carries on. Files themselves are unaffected: Truestill has never
  taken a photo's date from the file's timestamp. A copy that genuinely fails part-way through is
  still discarded, exactly as before.
- **Undoing a layout migration now appears in your run history.** Truestill keeps a permanent
  one-line history of every run beside your catalog, and reversing a migration was the one
  operation that left no trace - so the newest thing the history described was a state your disk
  was no longer in. The reversal now records what it put back, and names the run it reversed.
- **Restoring after a lost catalog now brings your event names back.** If your catalog was
  rebuilt, `truestill restore` could only re-attach names to events the catalog already knew -
  and a rebuilt catalog knows none, so every event name was reported unmatched and lost. Restore
  now regroups your library's own photos and, when a group exactly matches one you had named,
  recreates the event with your name and its photos - telling you each name it brought back.
  Groups that no longer match are still reported honestly rather than guessed at.
- **Lowering the event-grouping threshold now holds everywhere.** If you set a smaller minimum
  group size and named an event with fewer photos than the old default of eight, re-importing
  those photos quietly ignored your setting and skipped re-filing them under the event's folder.
  Every place that proposes event groups now reads the threshold you chose.
- **Photos with accented or non-English filenames no longer risk landing in `Undated/` on
  Windows.** Truestill reads photo details through exiftool, and the reply was being decoded
  with the machine's regional code page - on Windows that quietly garbled any non-ASCII
  filename, so a correctly-dated photo was filed as if it had no date at all, with no warning.
  Every reply is now read as UTF-8, the encoding exiftool actually writes, on every platform -
  and the same fix covers cloud-backup listings, where a garbled name made Truestill re-upload
  files it already had.
- **The other half of the same defect: filenames now reach exiftool intact on Windows too.**
  Fixing the reply was not enough - a real Windows run then proved the request was also losing
  non-ASCII names, because Windows hands them to exiftool through the same regional code page.
  Truestill now sends exiftool its file lists over a direct pipe instead of the command line,
  on every platform, so what exiftool reads is byte-for-byte the name on disk.
- **A file Truestill is not allowed to look at is no longer reported as missing.** If a folder's
  permissions blocked reading, verify counted its files as gone from the drive - a loss that had
  not happened - and undo treated the blocked original location as free to move a file back onto.
  Both now say plainly that the file could not be examined, and undo moves nothing it cannot see.
- **Removing empty folders now waits its turn.** The app's "remove empty folders" could run while
  an organize was creating those very folders, or while another Truestill held the drive - it now
  takes the same turn-taking every other drive operation uses, and says who has the drive if it
  must wait.
- **At an unplugged drive's usual folder, the app no longer suggests registering it as new.** It
  now says which drive it thinks belongs there and asks you to plug it in - the same answer the
  command line gives, word for word.
- **Backing up to an unplugged drive's usual folder is now refused instead of silently going to
  the wrong disk.** If your backup drive was not mounted, its folder looks empty - and copying
  there would put the files on your computer's own disk under a new drive identity, hidden the
  moment the real drive came back. Truestill now recognises the folder as your drive's recorded
  home, says which drive it thinks is missing, and asks you to plug it in first.
- **A busy library catalog no longer shows up as "Internal Server Error".** If the catalog was
  briefly in use when you changed a setting, the app showed a raw server error. It now waits
  once, and if the catalog is still busy it says so plainly and suggests trying again - without
  blaming a second Truestill window it cannot see.
- **Undo no longer reports a problem, or stays armed, over files it was never going to move.**
  After reversing an organize, Truestill could keep offering to undo a run it had already fully
  reversed, and report failure over files that had been copied rather than moved - neither of
  which any further undo could change. It now separates *nothing to undo* from *you can fix this
  and try again*, and only the second keeps the run open.
- **Organising in place can no longer leave a photo stranded if the run is interrupted.** When
  Truestill reorganises a drive by moving files on it, it now writes down each move *before* making
  it. Previously the note was written afterwards, so a crash in between could leave a photo in its
  new place with nothing recording where it came from - and **Undo would report success while that
  photo stayed put**. Undo now also checks that a file really is the one it is putting back, and
  says plainly when something could not be restored.
- **A run that stops early now says what it managed before it stopped.** If a drive filled up
  part-way through organizing, Truestill stopped - correctly - but the run record either was not
  written at all, or said that none of your photos had been attempted, when some were already
  safely copied. The record now names every file that made it, the one that hit the problem, and
  what stopped the run.
- **Two Truestill windows, or a window and a terminal, can no longer overwrite each other's
  photos.** Organizing the same folder from two places at once could leave one copy holding the
  other's picture, with Truestill reporting success for both. Whichever starts second now says
  which drive is busy and what is running on it, and waits its turn. Under *move* or *organize in
  place* that overwrite destroyed the only copy, so this is the case it matters most for.
- **Starting Truestill twice at once no longer tells you to delete your library's catalog.** If
  two runs began before the catalog existed, the second saw an empty file and offered to delete
  it - while the first was still writing it. It now waits a moment for the first to finish, and
  if something really is wrong it says so without suggesting you delete anything.
- **A full or read-only home folder no longer stops Truestill starting.** The app records the
  address it is serving on in a small file; if that folder will not take a write - the disk is
  full, or the folder is read-only - Truestill used to stop with a Python error before it started.
  It now says which folder it could not write to and why, in plain words, and carries on starting.
- **`--apply` no longer prints the whole plan a second time before doing it.** Organizing a real
  library printed about fifteen thousand lines listing every file and why - useful when you are
  deciding whether to run it, and in the way when you already have. A preview still explains every
  file; a run you have authorised now shows the counts and gets on with it, and `last-run.json`
  holds the per-file detail.
- **A folder Truestill could not open is no longer described as one with something in it.**
  `clean-empty` listed such a folder under *"something is in there"* with an empty bracket beside
  it - two claims that contradicted each other, when the truth was that Truestill could not look
  inside. It now says *"could not be opened"* and lists those folders separately.
- **Every run now writes down what it did, so you can find out later which photos failed.**
  Truestill keeps a `last-run.json` beside your catalog, written automatically, listing every file
  and what happened to it - organized, failed and why, or never attempted because the run stopped.
  Before this, that answer existed only in the terminal, and scrolled away with it. The run tells
  you where the file is; `--report PATH` puts it somewhere else instead.
- **A drive Truestill cannot read is no longer registered as a brand-new one.** If a folder holds
  your library but most of it will not open - a half-mounted drive, a folder still syncing -
  Truestill used to quietly decide it was somewhere new and give your library a second identity,
  which made it count one copy of your photos as two. It now says it could not read the folder,
  says how much of it would not open, and stops. If the folder really is a new place, add
  `--force-new-identity` and it registers.
- **`truestill reclaim` now asks you to type `delete originals`, and tells you what that means.**
  It deletes your original photos after checking their contents against your backup drive, and it
  used to ask for the word `delete` behind a single line of warning - less ceremony than removing
  an empty folder. It now says plainly that these are your originals rather than spare copies,
  that they do not go to the trash, and that it cannot be undone. Typing the old word no longer
  does anything.
- **A run that cannot write to your drive no longer prints thousands of near-identical lines.**
  Organizing 2,110 photos to a folder Truestill could not write to used to print **2,096 failure
  lines**, all saying the same thing, next to a summary that had already told you the number. It
  now names the first twenty and says *"... and 2,074 more (all the same reason)"* - or how many
  different reasons there were, if they were not all the same. Redirecting the output to a file
  never helped, because those lines went to the error stream; there are now twenty-five of them.
- **After `organize --in-place`, Truestill now tells you which folders it emptied.** The run
  always said it would report them and never did, and `truestill clean-empty` answered "no
  migration leftovers recorded" on a drive that plainly had some - it was only looking at the
  record a layout migration writes, not the one an in-place organize writes. Both are read now.
- **`clean-empty` can no longer remove a folder that something appeared in while you were
  reading the preview.** It now puts a folder's leftover OS junk in the trash and removes the
  folder itself with `rmdir`, which the system refuses if anything at all is still inside - so a
  photo that landed there a second before you typed `clean` keeps the folder, and both survive.
  The run tells you which folder it could not remove and what already went to the trash. The
  preview now also says plainly, on every run, that the folder itself is removed outright and that
  a folder which is no longer empty will be left alone; it used to say that only with
  `--permanent`, which is the one case where it was least likely to apply.
- **Truestill no longer crashes when the folder for your catalog cannot be written.** A
  read-only or full disk used to end in a Python stack trace before anything ran; now it says
  what to check and stops. The message was also corrected so it is true of a command that wrote
  nothing - it no longer describes work that never happened.
- **A run whose catalog cannot be written now stops and tells you, instead of ending in a
  traceback and leaving a photo nothing recorded.** If the folder holding your catalog becomes
  read-only, fills up, or goes away mid-run, Truestill stops and says what it organized, what it
  recorded, that the two match, and what to check - and it removes the one copy it had just made
  but could not record, so nothing is left on the drive that the catalog does not know about.
  Before, that leftover copy became a duplicate with a `_1` on the end the next time you ran
  organize. Under `--in-place` the file is your only copy, so it is left alone and named instead.
  If another Truestill window is simply using the catalog, the run now waits for it rather than
  giving up.

### Added
- **If you lose your catalog, your names come back from your drives.** `truestill restore <path>`
  reads the decisions file Truestill keeps on each drive and puts your trip and event names,
  dismissed groups and corrected dates back. It works on a brand-new machine with an empty
  catalog and nothing registered, which is the whole point of it. It **shows you what it would do
  first** and only acts when you type `restore`, and it tells you what it could *not* place -
  a name whose photos have changed, or a correction for a photo this computer has not scanned
  yet - rather than reporting only the good half.
- **Your drives now tell you what they are carrying.** Both `truestill drives` and the Backups
  screen say when each drive's copy was saved, when it is behind what is on this computer, when
  it holds names this computer does not have, and when a save to it failed - which is the first
  time a failed save has been visible anywhere.
- **Your names now live on your drives, so losing the catalog no longer loses them.** Truestill
  keeps a small file - `.truestill-decisions.json`, beside the drive marker at the top of each
  registered drive - holding **only what a person decided**: trip and event names, the drive's
  label, dismissed groups, and dates you corrected by hand. Everything else it knows is
  recomputable by reading your photos again; those names are not, because nobody but you ever
  knew them.
  It is written after any work that changed the catalog, to every drive that is plugged in, and
  it is **plain readable text** - you can open it in any text editor, on any machine, with
  Truestill nowhere in sight. That is the point of it. About a kilobyte.
  **The first time you run this version it saves a copy straight away**, so a library you
  finished naming months ago is covered without you having to rename anything, and it says so
  once. After that it is silent unless something goes wrong: a drive that is full, write-
  protected, or that already holds names this catalog does not have is reported rather than
  written over.
- **Naming a trip or event now suggests a name taken from your own folders.** If the photos in a
  group came from a folder you named - `Rock Climbing`, `Riverside Mall 2015` - Truestill offers that
  name under the box, with a **Use** button. It is only ever an offer: **the box stays empty until
  you click Use or type something**, so leaving a card alone still skips it exactly as before.
  Typing your own name puts the offer away.
  The suggestion is tidied but never invented. Apostrophes are dropped because they break shell
  scripts, `~` and `_` read as spaces, and a year that only repeats the year in the folder above
  is removed - `Wayanad '14` becomes **Wayanad**. Hyphens inside a name are left alone, so
  `TCS-M05-Batch` arrives as it is. **Nothing is spell-checked**: your places and people are not
  in any dictionary, and a confidently wrong correction would be worse than no suggestion at all.
  A group you have already named shows its name instead, and is never offered a suggestion.

### Fixed
- **Test builds can no longer be mistaken for releases.** A build made from a branch rather than a
  release tag used to be stamped with the branch's name on Windows, and with `0.0.0` on Linux -
  which looks exactly like a real version. Such builds are now marked plainly as development
  builds and name the run that produced them, and a release tag that is not a proper version
  number is refused rather than guessed at.
- **Truestill no longer offers to register a backup drive that is simply not plugged in.** When a
  drive is unmounted, the folder it lived in looks exactly like an empty new folder - the computer
  cannot tell them apart. Truestill now remembers where each drive was last seen, so it recognises
  the case and says the drive is probably not connected, instead of suggesting you register the
  folder again. Doing that used to create a second entry for a library you already had, and left
  files in the folder that hid the real drive when it came back.
- **A folder Truestill cannot open is never described as one that isn't there.** The two are
  different answers: a folder that does not exist can be created, and one that refuses cannot -
  so offering to create it just fails again. Truestill now decides this from a single check that
  behaves the same on every supported version of Python, instead of one that changed underneath
  it. The same distinction is restored where a backup drive is examined, where an original photo
  is looked for beside its edit, and where a destination is checked before writing.
- **Tidying up empty folders no longer stops with an error when one of them cannot be opened.**
  The folder is listed as still occupied instead, so Truestill leaves it alone rather than failing
  the whole tidy-up at the end of an otherwise successful run.
- **Reclaiming space no longer stops with an error when a backed-up copy cannot be read.** It
  counts that copy as unverified and moves on, which is what it always meant to do - and it never
  deletes anything it could not check.
- **Truestill no longer prints its image libraries' error messages at you, and now says what it
  could not check.** A run over damaged photos used to fill the terminal with hundreds of lines
  like `Fax3Decode2D: Bad code word at line 1003 of strip 0` - written for programmers, about
  files it did not name - so a working run looked broken. Those are counted and summarised in one
  line instead. More importantly, Truestill now tells you when it could not open a photo well
  enough to compare it for near-duplicates: those files are still organized and identical copies
  are still found, but until now nothing said the check had been skipped.
- **A file Truestill could not use now comes with advice that fits.** Every such file used to be
  told to "fix the permission or check the disk", including damaged photos whose permissions and
  disk are perfectly fine.
- **Organizing now tells you about folders it did not look inside.** If you keep photos in a
  folder whose name starts with a dot, Truestill skips it on purpose - but it used to say nothing
  at all, so a folder of 21 photos could report "3 organized" and look like a success. It now
  names the folder, says its contents are unknown, and tells you how to include it. Hidden files
  like `.picasa.ini` are named too. Truestill never guesses how many photos are inside a folder it
  did not open, because that number is exactly what it does not know.
- **A drive Truestill has just checked is no longer described as never checked.** If a check
  found some files missing, the drive used to be listed as one nothing had ever looked at - on the
  same screen that had just reported what was missing. It now says it was checked and has gaps.
  Drives nothing has actually looked at are still called out, which is the point of the wording.
- **One unreadable photo no longer stops the whole run.** A file whose contents an image reader
  cannot make sense of - a truncated phone photo, a picture with a damaged section - used to end
  the run then and there, with nothing organized and no report. Truestill now organizes everything
  else and tells you which files it could not make sense of, by name.
- **Photos saved as HEIC are no longer shown on their side, or described the wrong way round.**
  A HEIC can record "turn this a quarter turn" in two different places, and Truestill was reading
  one of them in the picture and the other in the description - so some portrait photos were drawn
  landscape, and some were drawn correctly but reported as landscape. Both now agree. Photos that
  were already right are untouched: the fix can tell the two apart.
- **Setting up a new drive on a full disk now tells you so, instead of crashing.** Pointing
  `organize` at a folder that is not a drive yet, on a disk with no room, used to end in a Python
  stack trace - a few steps from a copy that would have named every file it could not write.
  Truestill now checks that the drive can hold the run *before* it sets the drive up, and says
  "Not enough room: this needs about 4.2 GB and the drive has 190 MB free". Nothing is written:
  no marker on the drive, no half-registered drive in your library.
- **A drive that will not take a marker is now a sentence rather than a crash**, whether it is
  full, out of allowance, read-only, or unplugged part-way through - and it no longer leaves an
  empty marker file behind on the drive.
- **A completely full drive is no longer reported as having exactly enough room.** A disk with
  zero bytes free and a disk Truestill could not measure at all were being treated as the same
  thing, so the space check passed on a drive that could not take a single file.
- **`truestill catalog` no longer claims your catalog is in the wrong place when it is not.** If
  any part of the path to your Truestill folder was a shortcut - common on Linux and macOS where
  a home folder or a data drive is linked elsewhere - Truestill compared two spellings of the same
  file, decided they were different, and told you to move a catalog that was already exactly where
  it belongs. It now asks whether two paths are the same *file* rather than the same *text*, and
  the self-check no longer labels a current catalog as an older one.
- **Truestill no longer opens a different library depending on which folder you ran it from.**
  Very early versions kept the catalog in a `reports/` folder next to wherever you happened to be,
  and Truestill still looked there first - so the same installation could show you one library
  from one folder and another from somewhere else, with nothing said about it. It now always uses
  its proper location, or the one you set with `TRUESTILL_DATA_DIR`. If you have an old
  `reports/catalog.sqlite`, `truestill catalog --move` copies it across, and it is left untouched
  until you delete it yourself.
- **An upgrade that is interrupted now leaves your library exactly as it was.** When Truestill
  updates the shape of its catalog, it does that in steps. If the power went out, or you closed
  the laptop, part of a step could already be written while Truestill still believed the older
  shape was in place - so the next launch could meet an error it could not explain. Each step is
  now all or nothing: it either finishes completely or leaves nothing behind, and the next launch
  simply carries on. **The same change fixed a rarer problem** where opening Truestill twice
  while an upgrade was pending could report a broken catalog.
- **Checking a copied drive now tells you it is a copy.** If you clone a drive - or restore one
  from an image - both copies carry the same drive identity, which is correct: they are the same
  library until they drift apart. But Truestill counted them as **one** place, so it told you your
  photos were in fewer places than they really were, which is the wrong direction to be wrong in.
  Now, when a drive answers in two places at once, `truestill verify` and the Check screen say so:
  both folders, when the other was last seen, and the command to give one its own identity if they
  are genuinely two drives. **It never decides for you** - nothing is renamed, split or refused.
  A drive you simply *moved* says nothing, because a move and a copy whose original is unplugged
  look identical and warning about every move would be noise.
- **If you tell Truestill where to keep its files, it now listens.** Setting `TRUESTILL_DATA_DIR`
  used to be quietly ignored whenever there was a `reports/catalog.sqlite` in the folder you
  happened to run from - so you could be organizing photos into a different catalog than the one
  you named, with nothing on screen saying which. The setting now wins, an empty setting counts as
  not set, and Truestill says which catalog it chose and why. **An existing library is still never
  left behind**: if the location you named has no catalog yet, the one you already have is used,
  and Truestill tells you that is what happened.
- **Screens that open several things at once no longer queue behind each other.** Every time
  Truestill opened your library it briefly took the same exclusive lock it needs to *build* a
  library, even when it was only going to read. One screen fires several requests at once, so
  they took turns for no reason: the slowest of twelve simultaneous opens went from **232 ms to
  4 ms**. Nothing about your data changed, and a brand-new library is still built exactly once.
- **An empty file where your catalog should be now stops Truestill instead of becoming your
  library.** If a copy of your catalog ran out of disk part-way, or a run was interrupted before
  it wrote anything, what is left behind is a file of **zero bytes** wearing your catalog's name.
  Truestill used to open it, build a fresh empty library into it, and call it *"an empty
  catalog"* - which looks exactly like starting over, and made the on-screen advice to *"delete
  the old one when you are happy"* point at the file that still had your photos in it. It now
  refuses to open it, says the file is empty and that your real library is untouched, and tells
  you to rename or delete it or to pass `--db` to the catalog you meant. **A genuine first run is
  unaffected** - there is no file at all in that case, which is a different thing.
- **Reloading the page during a run no longer leaves you watching a spinner that never ends.**
  If you reloaded, or the connection dropped and came back, Truestill reconnected to the running
  job and then waited for news that had already been delivered to the page you left - so the
  screen sat there with no outcome, however the run actually ended. It now tells you how the job
  finished. The same fault kept Truestill from shutting down cleanly while a run was on screen.
- **Screens now announce that they are still loading.** Each screen marks itself busy while the
  content it opens with is on its way, and clear when it has arrived, so a screen reader says so
  instead of reading a half-filled page as finished. A failure in one of those background
  requests is now reported deliberately rather than through the catch-all that exists for
  unforeseen bugs. **A screen that fails still shows its placeholder** - replacing that with a
  failure card is a separate change, not yet made.

- **A run that loses contact with Truestill now tells you, instead of freezing.** If the live
  connection to a running job died - which could happen when you pressed Cancel just as the work
  finished - the screen simply stopped. It kept whatever it was showing before the run, the button
  stayed greyed out, and there was **no message, no error, and no way to find out what had
  happened**. It now says plainly that contact was lost, that the job may have finished or been
  stopped, and to check the folder before running it again. This affects every kind of run -
  organizing, backing up, checking, rearranging, importing - because they all share the same
  machinery.
- **Organizing by copy no longer asks you to type "move".** The confirm box wanted the same word
  whichever mode you chose, so copying - which leaves your originals exactly where they are -
  asked you to type *move* to go ahead. It now asks for the word that matches what will happen:
  **copy** when copying, **move** when moving or reorganizing in place. That is also the word the
  command line already uses, so the two do not disagree.
  The same box used to warn *"This run is not reversible with undo-organize"* while copying. True,
  but it read as a hazard warning on the one mode that changes nothing. It now says what actually
  matters - *your originals are not changed, so there is nothing for undo-organize to put back*.
- **A folder with nothing left to organize says so, instead of asking you to type a word first.**
  Organizing the same folder twice showed the full confirmation ceremony and ended in a button
  reading **"Organize 0 files"**. It was counting the files it FOUND to decide whether to ask, and
  counting the files it would ORGANIZE on the button. It now checks the second one and simply
  tells you everything there is already organized.
- **A trip or an event you have already named no longer asks you to name it again.** Opening Trips & events
  re-offers every trip it can see, including ones you named earlier. Those came back with an empty
  name box, exactly like a trip that had never been named - and anything you typed into it was
  discarded without a word. Anything you have already named now shows its name instead of a box,
  and says that renaming is not available on that screen rather than pretending to accept one.
  **A group of photos that has since grown or shrunk still asks**, and that is deliberate: adding
  one photo to an evening makes it a different group from the one you named, so Truestill treats
  it as new rather than quietly filing it under the old name.
- **Two events on the same day with the same name now get separate folders, as the preview always
  said they would.** Truestill has always noticed that a second event named *Goa Trip* on the same
  date would spell the same folder as the first, and the preview offered to file it as
  *Goa Trip (2)*. It worked out that name and then did not use it: both events were placed in one
  folder, and the note described something that never happened. The preview and the result now
  agree. Nothing was lost - the photos were all there, under one folder instead of two - but where
  they landed was not what you were told.
  If you already have events that merged this way, a **Rearrange your library** run will now offer
  to separate them.

### Changed
- **The Truestill name in the sidebar is back to the monospace lettering, with the indigo dot.**
  It was briefly set in a serif; that took the name out of the one thing it was chosen to lead,
  since every path, count and date in Truestill is set in the same monospace. The **TS** mark on
  the collapsed sidebar and the app icons are unchanged.
- **The sidebar no longer warns you about the step you are in the middle of.** If nothing has
  been copied to a backup drive yet, that is progress rather than a problem, and it now reads
  quietly - *"not on a backup drive yet"* - instead of in the warning colour. This is also the
  normal, permanent state for anyone organizing to a cloud remote with `--rclone`, who was being
  told their photos were at risk for a choice they had made deliberately.
  The warning colour is now kept for the one case you can act on: *"N files in only one place"*.
  It carries a **⚠ marker** as well as the colour, so the difference does not depend on seeing
  colour at all.
  **Files Truestill has no copy of anywhere have moved to the Stats screen**, where there is
  room to say what they are and what to do. They are counted as *"not on a registered drive"*
  with both ordinary explanations - a cloud remote, or files organized from the command line
  before it registered its destination - and Truestill does not guess which applies to you.

### Fixed
- **Photos organized from the command line are now actually in Truestill's care.** Organizing
  into an ordinary folder recorded the photos but never registered the folder, so they existed
  in a strange half-state: Truestill knew about them well enough to skip them as duplicates on a
  later run, but `truestill verify` could not check them, `truestill status` did not count them
  toward keeping copies in two places, and `truestill where` could not find them. **The app has
  never had this problem** - it registers the destination before it writes anything - so which
  of the two you used silently decided whether your photos were being looked after.
  The command line now registers the destination too, which writes one small
  `.truestill-drive.json` file into it, exactly as the app does. **A preview still writes
  nothing at all**, so trying Truestill out against a scratch folder leaves it untouched unless
  you ask for the real run with `--apply`. A folder that is already a registered drive keeps the
  identity and the name it has.
  **Photos organized this way before today are not repaired by this** - the fix stops it
  happening again, it does not go back. If `truestill status` reports fewer files than you
  expect, that is why.
- **The sidebar strip was telling you your photos were safe when they were not.** It read
  *"safe in 2 places"*, and the 2 was the number of backup drives holding *anything at all* -
  not the number of places your photos are. Organize into one drive, then organize different
  photos into a second, and every single photo sat in exactly one place while the strip said
  two. On the maintainer's own library it said "safe in 2 places" while **31 files had no
  recorded copy on any drive**.
  It now counts your **files**, not your drives, and it leads with the risk: *"31 files not on a
  drive yet"*, or *"4 files in only one place"*. The reassuring version - *"every file in 2
  places"* - appears only when it is true of **every** file, and the three squares fill from the
  least-protected file, so they can never promise more than your worst-off photo has.
  **The word "safe" is gone**, deliberately. Truestill knows where copies were recorded; that is
  not the same as having checked they are still there. Use **Check now** on the Backups screen
  for that.
  The photo and video totals have gone from the strip - they never changed and asked nothing.
  And the catalog path no longer collapses to a fragment like `…e` when the sidebar animates.

### Changed
- **The sidebar is now a dark rail in both light and dark mode.** Collapsing it swaps the name
  for a **TS** mark, which is drawn artwork rather than text in a font, so it looks the same on
  every computer - a font would have rendered differently on Linux, where the one the brand sheet
  names is not installed. (The full name itself is set in Truestill's own monospace; see the
  entry at the top of this release.)
  The seven screens are unchanged and still flat; they are only grouped now under **Main** and
  **Settings**. **The browser tab shows a Truestill icon** instead of a blank page.
  Collapsing is now a small round chevron sitting on the edge between the sidebar and the page,
  rather than a row that looked like another place you could go to. It moves with the edge when
  the sidebar opens and closes, still works from the keyboard, and still announces itself as
  Collapse or Expand. On a narrow window, where the sidebar becomes a bar across the top and
  there is no edge to sit on, it is not shown.

### Fixed
- **The sidebar stays where it is when you scroll a long screen.** On a tall screen - Settings,
  or a big result - scrolling moved the whole window, so the navigation slid up off the top and
  you had to scroll back to reach it. The navigation now stays put and only the content moves.
  **And switching screens takes you to the top of the new one.** It used to keep whatever
  scroll position you were at, so moving from a scrolled screen to another one dropped you into
  the middle of it, often into blank space below the content.
  **On a narrow window nothing changes, on purpose.** There the navigation is a bar across the
  top rather than a column, and holding it in place would spend most of a short window on
  navigation instead of on your photos.

### Changed
- **After cleaning up empty folders, the app now tells you where they went.** It used to say
  "Removed 3 folders", which is the same sentence whether they are sitting in your trash and can
  be put back or are gone for good. Truestill knew which; the screen added the two numbers
  together and showed the total. It now says **"3 folders moved to the trash"**, and names a
  permanent removal as permanent when that is what happened. A run that removed nothing says so
  plainly rather than reporting a removal with a zero in it.
- **And when there is no trash to use, the app now tells you what to do about it.** The previous
  release stopped Truestill from deleting those folders outright, which is right - but the
  message said only that they could not be removed, which left you correct and stuck. It now
  shows the exact command that will remove them from a terminal, and says in the same breath
  that it cannot be undone and asks for a different word because of that.
- **If Truestill cannot reach a trash, it now leaves the folders alone instead of deleting
  them.** This is the second half of the change below, and it is the one that matters. Truestill
  removes leftover empty folders by putting them in the trash, and it always refused to do
  anything else when a *drive* turned the trash down - a network or cloud drive often does. But
  when the whole *machine* had no trash it did the opposite: it removed the folders outright.
  Those are two situations you cannot tell apart from the outside, and they had opposite
  outcomes, with the permanent one happening on its own.
  Now they behave the same way. Every folder is left exactly where it is, and each one is named
  on screen with the reason, so nothing is quietly skipped either. **The only way Truestill will
  ever delete a folder outright is `truestill clean-empty --permanent`**, which asks you to type
  `delete forever` rather than `clean` - a different question for a different answer. That was
  always the intent; it is now the only route.
  If you have been using Truestill on Linux, nothing changes for you: you had a trash and still
  do. Nothing about your photos was ever at risk here - only the empty folders left behind after
  a move, which by then contain nothing but system files like `.DS_Store`.
- **Removing leftover empty folders now uses your system's trash on every platform, not only on
  a Linux desktop.** Truestill has always tried to put a removed folder in the trash so you can
  get it back. What it could not do was guarantee it had a trash to use: it looked for an
  optional helper, then for a Linux tool called `gio`, and where it found neither it removed the
  folder outright instead. Because `gio` is a Linux component, "neither" was the ordinary
  situation on **Windows and macOS** - so the recoverable behaviour was the one Linux users got
  by accident, and the permanent one was the default everywhere else. Truestill said which of
  the two was about to happen before asking you to confirm, so nothing was ever hidden, but the
  answer depended on the machine rather than on anything you chose.
  The helper is now a required part of Truestill rather than an optional one, so the trash is
  always available. On Windows that means the Recycle Bin; on macOS and Linux, the desktop
  trash. It adds no download of any size worth mentioning and brings nothing else with it.
  **A test now checks this on Windows, macOS and Linux on every build**, because the old
  behaviour was decided by a value nobody had ever measured on the platforms it affected.
- **What Truestill costs on a cloud drive is now written down, and it still will not guess how
  long a run will take.** Measured on one encrypted cloud mount: a 32,628-file census took
  **21 seconds**, while reading those files for duplicates and dates moved 29.4 GB at about
  **9 MB/s** - roughly 53 minutes, with the processor 3% busy the whole time. The wait is your
  connection, not your computer. Encryption adds its own cost on top, because the files are
  decrypted on your machine as well as pulled over the wire. `README.md` carries the short
  version and `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §5.2 the detail, including that this is **one mount on one
  connection** and not a claim about Truestill's speed.
  **No finishing time is shown, on purpose.** The obvious way to guess one is to time the fast
  census and scale it up - but that reads folder listings while the slow part reads the files
  themselves, and a cloud client that keeps listings on your machine makes the census fast no
  matter how slow the link is. The guess would be confident and wrong. Truestill tells you how
  much it needs to read before it starts, and says plainly that how long that takes depends on
  your disk or connection.
- **If your Linux desktop indexes your files, exclude your cloud drive from it.** GNOME's file
  indexer opens every file it finds to read metadata - and on a cloud drive, *opening* a file
  **downloads** it. Organize into a cloud folder inside your home directory and the indexer can
  quietly pull your entire library back down behind you, filling your disk and saturating your
  connection, looking for all the world like Truestill being slow. `docs/moving-machines.md`
  has the settings that stop it, including the measured detail that **adding an exclusion did
  not work** and narrowing the indexed folders did.
- **Truestill now tells you when it has passed over a hidden file or a hidden folder.** It
  still skips them, and that is deliberate: the hidden folders on a typical computer are
  `.Trash`, `.thumbnails` and the caches your operating system keeps, and sweeping those into
  your library would be worse than leaving them alone. What was wrong is that it said nothing.
  **If you keep photos in a hidden folder, you saw no sign of them at all** - not a count, not a
  name, nothing. Now the folder is named, so you can rename it without the leading dot and run
  again to bring those photos in.
  Hidden *files* are listed by name, so you can see that the thing skipped was your own
  `.picasa.ini` rather than something anonymous. And **Truestill's own `.truestill-drive.json`
  is listed separately** rather than counted among yours - it is hidden too, and one of the
  hidden files being ours is exactly the sort of thing that makes a count confusing.
  **Nothing about which photos get organized has changed.**
- **`truestill analyze` now shows you what it is doing while it does it, and its report survives
  being saved to a file.** On a 192 GB library the census appeared in 21 seconds and then
  **nothing happened on screen for 53 minutes** - the work was running the whole time, but there
  was no way to tell that from the outside. Now each stage reports as it finishes, and a counter
  shows the slow stages moving.
  **Saving the report works properly.** `truestill analyze <folder> > report.txt` puts the
  report in the file and the progress counter on your screen, so the file stays clean and
  readable - the same way `git` and `docker` behave. It used to write the progress counter into
  the file too: **127 KB of it** on that library, one line per file, which made the report
  almost unusable. Piping into `less`, `tee` or a log file all behave now.
  **And the report no longer waits for the end.** Redirected to a file, nothing at all appeared
  until the whole run finished; the early answers are now written out as soon as they are ready,
  which is the entire point of getting a cheap answer first.
  **What is not measured still says so.** A stage that has not run is named and left without a
  number, never shown as a `0` - a zero would mean "none found", and nothing has looked yet.
  Stopping with Ctrl-C still keeps everything printed so far and still refuses to give a partial
  duplicate count, because a half-finished count is a wrong answer rather than an incomplete one.
- **If your drive is unplugged part-way through organizing, Truestill now stops and tells you,
  instead of quietly filling up your computer.** A cloud drive that drops out under a long copy
  leaves an ordinary empty folder behind where it used to be - so writing carried on, into your
  computer's own disk, rebuilding the library there. Truestill already refused to *create*
  folders that way; now a long run also checks, every few seconds, that the drive it started on
  is still the drive it is writing to, and that this computer still has room. If either stops
  being true it stops, says which, and says what to do about it.
  **Everything already copied stays, and the run picks up where it left off** when you plug the
  drive back in and run again. Nothing is left half-written.
  **It is deliberately slow to complain.** A drive that hiccups for a moment is not a drive that
  has gone: it takes three bad readings over fifteen seconds before Truestill will stop a run.
  A check that interrupts healthy work gets switched off, and takes its real protection with it.
  **This now covers all three long jobs** - organizing, changing your folder layout, and backing
  up to a second drive. Changing the layout is the one worth knowing about: it rewrites every
  file, so on a cloud drive it pushes your whole library through that client's cache, and it
  previously had no free-space check of any kind. Backing up had one, but it was measuring the
  *drive*, which is exactly the disk that is not the problem.
- **When Truestill skips duplicates, it now tells you where their twins are.** A run used to
  report a number - *"2,057 duplicates, skipped"* - and stop there. That number meant two
  completely different things and gave you no way to tell which: either **Truestill already had
  those photos in your library**, in which case the copies in your source folder are redundant
  and you can clear them out, or **your source folder simply contained each photo twice**, which
  tells you nothing about your library at all. The count is now split - *"5 already in your
  library, 3 earlier in this batch"* - in the preview, in the run summary, in Analyze and on the
  screen in the app.
  **Nothing was deleted, then or now.** A skipped duplicate is a file that was not *copied* a
  second time; your originals are untouched, which is what the wording now says plainly. The
  screen also used to describe every duplicate as *"identical to a kept file"*, which was simply
  wrong when the twin was already in your library and there was no such file in the batch.
- **Photos and videos your phone named itself now join your timeline instead of landing in
  `Saved/`.** Android's camera writes files called `IMG_20140105_181210.jpg` and
  `VID_20140817_155317.mp4` - the date and time the shutter fired, in the name. On some phones,
  and after some copies between computers, that name is *all* that survives: the camera make and
  model come through blank. Truestill was already reading the date out of those files and filing
  them correctly by month - it just would not call them your photos, so they went to `Saved/`,
  the folder for files whose origin is unknown. On the library this was found in, **every single
  file in `Saved/` was one of these**. They now go where they always belonged.
  **A timestamp alone is still not enough**, and that is deliberate: a film you saved from the
  web has a date inside it too. It takes the camera's own naming - the `IMG_`/`VID_` prefix
  *and* a full date and time - before Truestill will call something your photo. `IMG_1234.JPG`,
  which iPhones and Canon cameras use, is just a counter and is left alone.
  **This applies to files you organize from here on.** Anything already sitting in `Saved/`
  stays there; re-importing from the originals is what moves it.
- **A photo that still carries its camera's details now joins your timeline, even if it reached
  you through a messenger.** Truestill used to decide where a file belonged from its *name*
  first, so a photo sent to you as a *document* - which keeps the full camera information - went
  to `WhatsApp/` rather than to the month it was taken in. It was already being **dated** from
  that same camera information, which is what made the old behaviour hard to explain: trusted
  enough to date, not trusted enough to file. So a photo someone forwards back to you, or one
  you sent as a document and later re-imported, now joins the timeline instead of sitting in a
  messenger folder. It is your photo, with your camera's evidence on it.
  **This applies to files you organize from here on.** Anything already filed under `WhatsApp/`
  stays there, and `migrate-layout` will not move it either - a re-layout deliberately trusts a
  messenger folder rather than re-reading the files in it. Re-importing from the originals is
  what places them the new way.
  **Nothing changes for the ordinary case.** A photo sent normally through a messenger has its
  camera information stripped by the app before it ever reaches you, so there is nothing to go
  on but the name - those files stay exactly where they were, and Truestill still refuses to
  treat the date in a messenger filename as the date the photo was taken. Screenshots are
  unaffected too.
- **Truestill now keeps the camera and the location a photo records, instead of reading them
  and throwing them away.** Nothing shows them yet - this is the storage, and the screens come
  later - but it is worth knowing now, because **only files organized from here on will have
  them.** Older entries keep the columns empty; re-importing from the original files is what
  fills them in. Camera make, camera model and lens are kept; the serial number and owner name
  are **not**, and are not even read - they identify one device and one person, which is not
  something a tool that transmits nothing about your library should be writing down. Locations
  are kept exactly as the photo records them: 0N 0E is a real place off the coast of Africa and
  is stored as such, not confused with "no location recorded". **Your catalog file is upgraded
  automatically on first open and can no longer be read by an older Truestill.**
- **Reviewing trips on a drive you already organized now finds the same trips as reviewing
  them during an import.** It did not before. Truestill ends one outing and starts another when
  consecutive photos jump a long distance, and that check only ran on a fresh import - the
  screen that reviews an already-organized drive had no locations to work with, so it grouped on
  time alone. The same photos could therefore be offered as one trip on one screen and two on
  the other. **Trip suggestions on that screen may differ from what you saw before, and the new
  answer is the one the import path was already giving.** Nothing you have named or applied
  changes; this affects suggestions only. Photos with no location are unaffected and still group
  by time, which is most libraries.
- **An organize *preview* now exits `1` instead of `0` when it could not read one of your
  files.** Read this if you script Truestill: `truestill organize <src> <dst> && next_step` used
  to chain in this case and now stops. That is the intended behaviour, not a side effect - a
  preview exists to predict the run, the run exits `1` on those same files, and a `0` here meant
  the chain continued past a library Truestill could not fully account for. Nothing else about
  the exit codes changed: `1` has always been this CLI's *"finished, but something is wrong"*
  (`verify` uses it for a missing or mismatched copy, `organize --apply` for a failed one,
  `reclaim` for a skipped one), so no new code was introduced. **A preview over a fully readable
  source still exits `0`**, and `--apply` runs are unchanged. If you want the old
  keep-going behaviour, test the code explicitly (`code=$?; [ $code -le 1 ] && next_step`)
  rather than discarding it.
- **`ingest --takeout` is now `ingest --source`.** The old name described the motivating case
  rather than the feature: archive ingestion reads any `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tgz` or `.tar.gz` from
  any source, and every major photo service hands a user a `.zip`. `--source` is format-neutral
  and matches `organize`'s existing `source`. **`--takeout` keeps working, permanently** - it is
  a hidden alias resolving to the same value, not a deprecation, so existing scripts are safe.

### Added
- **`truestill analyze <folder>` tells you what is in a folder, in about a second, without
  changing anything.** Point it at any folder - one you have never organized, one you are not
  sure you want to organize - and it reports how many files are there, how much space they take,
  the split between photos, videos and audio, and every file format it found, with counts. It
  needs nothing else: no destination, no library, no setup. **It reads file names and sizes
  only and never opens your files**, which is why it is fast on a folder that would take much
  longer to organize.
  **It also tells you what it has *not* worked out.** Dates, duplicates and look-alikes need
  Truestill to actually read your photos, which this does not do - so instead of showing you a
  zero, it says plainly that nothing has looked yet, and points you at the organize preview,
  which does. A folder it could not open is named too, rather than counted as empty.
  **Analyze never changes your photos and never adds anything to your library.**
  It also says **how long it took**, and on a run of more than a second how many files a second
  it managed. That is there to set expectations rather than to boast: this report only reads
  names and sizes, so if it is slow, the parts of Truestill that have to read your actual photos
  will be much slower - useful to know before you start one.
  Folders with a long tail of odd file types stay readable: the file types are listed
  most-common-first and the rest are summarised (*"and 190 more (190 seen once each)"*) instead
  of filling the screen. **The totals are always exact** - only the list of names is shortened.

### Changed
- **The organize preview now tells you what is in your library, not just what it would do with
  it.** Before you commit to anything, it reports the **span of dates** your photos cover and how
  many fall in each year, how much space **identical copies** are wasting, and which files are
  the largest. These numbers existed before but only appeared *after* an organize had finished,
  which is the wrong way round for a preview.
  **Identical copies and look-alikes are counted separately, and only identical copies are
  described as space you get back.** A look-alike - the same photo at a different size or quality
  - is *kept* by Truestill and flagged for you to review, so calling its bytes "saved" would
  promise space that never arrives. Undated photos are counted on their own line rather than
  quietly left out of the years, so the numbers still add up to the number of files.

### Changed
- **Truestill now refuses, out loud, to write outside the folder you pointed it at.** It never
  did - every destination path it builds is assembled from a single filename it read off your
  disk - but nothing was actually *checking*, so the guarantee rested on how the code happened
  to be arranged rather than on a rule. There is now a rule. A path that is absolute, names a
  drive, or contains `..` is refused before anything is written, and the message names the path.
  **Folders you have symlinked elsewhere keep working** - a year folder living on a second disk
  is an ordinary setup, and the check reads the path rather than following it, so it cannot
  mistake your arrangement for an escape.

### Fixed
- **If a drive disconnects while Truestill is writing to it, Truestill now stops instead of
  quietly refilling your computer's own disk.** This is the one that could cost you real space
  without any warning. When a network or cloud drive drops - which they do under a long copy -
  the folder it was mounted at turns back into an ordinary empty folder on your computer.
  Writing to it *works*, so Truestill would carry on, **rebuild your whole library structure on
  your computer's disk**, and fill it. Now it notices the drive is no longer the one it started
  on, stops before creating anything, and tells you: nothing was written, reconnect the drive
  and run again, and it continues from where it stopped.
  **Moving files is covered by the same stop** - a `--move` run cannot delete an original,
  because the copy it would check is never made.

- **A photo that claims to have been taken in the future is no longer filed by that date.** Found
  on a real 32,628-photo library that reported its range as *2002 to 2051*: two files carried a
  capture date 25 years ahead, and Truestill believed them - which would have put them in a
  `2051/` folder and stretched the library's timeline by three decades. A date after today is
  impossible, so it is now **refused**, and Truestill carries on looking: if the file has another
  usable date it is used, and only if nothing is left does the photo go to `Undated/`.
  **It tells you when this happens**, because it usually means a camera's clock was wrong or the
  details were edited - and the original date cannot be recovered by any tool once it has been
  overwritten. **Photos taken today are never affected**: a full day of leeway is allowed for
  cameras running slightly fast and for timezone differences.
  Very old dates are still accepted. A scanned negative may genuinely be from 1962, and refusing
  it would throw away a true date that someone took care to record.

- **Organizing the same photo twice no longer puts two dates in its name.** A photo whose date
  came from its filename gets a name like `20140815_IMG_0001.jpg`. If Truestill later organized
  that same photo again once it could read the camera's own date - after you installed
  `exiftool`, say - it added the fuller stamp in front of the one already there, giving
  `20140815_143022_20140815_IMG_0001.jpg`, and again on every pass after that. The date Truestill
  wrote is now **upgraded in place** instead: you get `20140815_143022_IMG_0001.jpg`, the same
  answer you would have got by organizing once with everything known. **Only a date at the very
  start of the name, and only for the same day, is treated as Truestill's own** - a photo called
  `VID-20250804-WA0020.mp4` or `IMG_20140815_143000.jpg` is left to be stamped exactly as before,
  and if your own filename says a different day from the photo's metadata, your name is kept and
  the metadata date is added in front rather than replacing it. **Files already organized are not
  renamed**; this applies to copies made from here on.
- **A camera or app name that had to be shortened can no longer end in a dot, which Windows
  would have silently dropped.** Folder names were already protected against this; the label
  Truestill records for a source was not, so a very long camera model cut at 60 characters could
  keep a trailing dot. On Windows `Photos.` and `Photos` are the same folder and on Linux they
  are two, which is how one library starts reading differently on two machines. Both now follow
  one shared rule.
- **Using Truestill in two places at once now says so plainly, instead of showing you a
  crash.** Running a command in a terminal while the app is open is an ordinary thing to do, and
  the two share one library catalog. Only one of them can write to it at a time - which is
  correct, and is what keeps your library consistent - but the one that had to wait used to give
  up after five seconds with a wall of technical output ending in `database is locked`. It looked
  like something had broken. Nothing had. Both surfaces now stop with a sentence that says
  another Truestill operation is using the catalog, that a file is recorded only after it has
  been copied safely, and to try again once the other one finishes. **On the command line this
  has its own exit code (`5`), so a script can tell "try again shortly" apart from "you typed
  something wrong".** Real problems - a failing disk, a damaged catalog - are untouched and still
  report themselves in full, because being told to wait for a fault that will never clear is
  worse than seeing the error.
- **Truestill will no longer register the same library twice as two different drives.** If a
  drive's marker file went missing - copied to a new machine without it, restored from a backup
  that skipped hidden files - registering that folder used to create a *second* drive identity
  for photos Truestill already knew about. On the command line the new drive then showed **0
  files**, as though the backups had never existed. In the app it was quieter and worse: the new
  drive picked up all the files, and Truestill went on to report *"at least two drive copies"*
  for photos that existed in exactly one place. Registering now **stops and names the drive the
  folder already is**, having checked the file contents rather than just the names. If the drive
  simply moved, `truestill drives --init <folder> --label x --adopt-existing` re-attaches it
  under its original identity; if you really do have two drives holding the same photos,
  `--force-new-identity` registers the second one.
- **An unplugged drive no longer tells you to register it.** Pointing `verify`, `reclaim` or
  `migrate-layout` at a path that is not there said *"isn't a Truestill drive yet - register it
  with `truestill drives --init`"* - the one piece of advice that causes the problem above. It
  now asks whether the drive is plugged in. A folder that *is* there and simply is not a drive
  still gets the register suggestion, unchanged.
- **A photo Truestill could not read is no longer also counted among the ones it says it will
  organize.** The preview said both *"organized (unique): 5"* and *"files that could not be
  read: 2"* about the same seven photos, with the two unreadable ones inside the 5 - a file with
  no hash matches nothing, so it read as new. Every scanned file is now reported in exactly one
  bucket, and the buckets add up to the number of files scanned. **The CLI summary has a new
  `could not be read` line**, printed even when it is zero so the figures can be checked by
  adding them up; the app's *"new - will be organized"* count and the number on the confirm
  button both drop accordingly. Nothing about what a run *does* changed - an unreadable file is
  still attempted and still reported as failed; only the preview stopped promising it.
- **A photo Truestill cannot read is now named, instead of vanishing from the preview.** A file
  that is locked, permission-denied, on a failing disk, or moved away mid-scan produced empty
  hashes - **the same empty hashes** a file gets when the size pre-filter deliberately decides
  not to hash it. Nothing downstream could tell those apart, so on a preview, which copies
  nothing and therefore never reaches the run's "failed" outcome, the file was reported
  **nowhere at all** and the library looked clean. Both the CLI and the app now count these and
  name them one by one, with the reason for each - *permission denied*, *input/output error*,
  *disappeared during the scan* - because those are three different things to do about it. A
  long list is capped and says how many it hid. Unreadable **folders**, which the app has known
  about since the feature shipped but never actually drew on screen, are now displayed too;
  they are still named without a file count, because the number inside a folder that cannot be
  opened is precisely what is unknown.
- **A FAT32 drive can no longer swallow most of a run and then fail the videos.** FAT32 cannot
  store a file of 4 GiB or more, and 4K phone video crosses that routinely. Organize had no
  preflight of any kind, so a library with a few big videos organized nine thousand files and
  *then* failed N of them, one `[Errno 27] File too large` at a time, against a drive reporting
  200 GB free. Organize now checks what the destination can physically hold **before writing
  anything** and refuses, **naming the files that would fail** rather than counting or skipping
  them - a run that quietly omitted exactly the footage the user cared most about, and reported
  success, would be the worse outcome. The errno message itself now names FAT32 as the reason
  instead of passing the raw errno through. Detected from `/proc/mounts` on Linux and
  `GetVolumeInformationW` on Windows; **macOS reports unknown, and unknown never refuses
  anything**. Both the CLI and the app inherit the refusal, and both previews say so up front.
- **An archive holding a file too large for the drive is refused before it is unpacked.** The
  organize preflight above cannot cover this: an archive ingest extracts a staging tree onto the
  destination *first*, so a 5 GB video inside a zip would fail part way through the unpack with
  most of the tree already written. The precheck now names such entries from the archive's own
  headers - free, because the walk that totals the claim already reads every declared size - and
  the extractor's own write, the one path that does not go through the destination backend,
  names EFBIG the same way for a header that under-declares.

### Added
- **`truestill repoint-sources` - moved the folder you imported from? Point Truestill at where
  it went, once.** Truestill records where each photo came from, as a full path. Move or rename
  that folder and every one of those records goes stale: `reclaim` reports files it cannot find
  instead of offering to free space, and searches cite folders that no longer exist. Name the
  old folder and the new one and every record beneath it is updated in a single step - the whole
  tree, not file by file. **Your organized library needs none of this** and never did: those
  copies are recorded relative to the drive they live on, so a drive that reappears somewhere
  else just works.
  It shows you exactly what it would change and asks you to type `repoint` before changing
  anything. **It also checks the contents of the new folder before believing you**, and refuses
  outright if the files there are not the files it recorded - a folder with the right shape and
  the wrong photos is exactly the mistake that would later let `reclaim` delete the wrong file.
- **Truestill now says whether each of your backup drives is actually plugged in.** A drive you
  have unplugged reads as *not plugged in* rather than looking like every other drive in the
  list - and, deliberately, never as *missing* or as an error, because disconnecting an external
  drive is a normal thing to do and reconnecting it fixes everything by itself. A drive Truestill
  has not yet seen on this computer says so in its own words (*location not known yet*) instead
  of being reported as gone: not knowing where a drive is and knowing it is absent are different
  facts, and only one of them is worth worrying about. The command line shows the same three
  states in a new `STATUS` column, and `truestill verify` now remembers where it found a drive so
  that column has something to say.
- **Trips**: group multi-day photos into one folder, review and apply on disk.
- **In-place organize (`organize --in-place`)** for libraries that live on the drive itself -
  a pendrive or external HDD with no staging space to copy into. Files are moved by **rename**:
  no bytes are rewritten, no other process ever sees an instant at which the content does not
  exist, and the content hash is unchanged because the inode is. (Surviving a *power cut*
  intact is a property of journalling filesystems; on FAT32/exFAT pendrives the undo journal is
  what makes such a run recoverable.) Plain `--move` now takes the same
  fast path automatically wherever the filesystem allows; `--in-place` additionally *requires*
  it, refusing a cross-device destination rather than quietly consuming space the user said
  they did not have. `--apply` needs a typed `move` confirmation, and the run reports its
  mechanism split ("3 moved by rename · 1 copied across devices").
- **`truestill undo-organize`** - reverse an in-place run, restoring every file to its exact
  prior path. Preview by default, `--apply` to move; `--list` shows recorded runs, and
  `--source-root`/`--dest-root` handle a drive that has remounted elsewhere. It ships *with*
  the feature rather than after it: a rename cannot lose bytes, so what is at risk is the
  *arrangement* of a library whose owner, by definition of this feature, has no second copy.
- Catalog **schema v10**: `inplace_runs` + `inplace_moves`, a **reversible** journal (where
  each file moved) rather than an audit one (what was destroyed).

### Added
- **`truestill migrate-layout`** - move an existing library to a layout you have chosen. Shows
  the full plan first (where every label's files are headed, how many, sample paths, and how
  close the longest path comes to Windows' 260-character limit) and moves nothing until you type
  `move`. Each file is copied, re-hashed at its new home, and only then removed from the old
  one, so there is never a moment when it exists nowhere. An interrupted run resumes.
- **`truestill migrate-layout --undo`** - put a completed migration back. Walks the moves in
  reverse with the same verification going the other way, and **refuses any file that changed
  since the migration**, reporting it rather than overwriting your edit. Available until a later
  migration of the same drive replaces the record.
- **`truestill clean-empty`** - remove the empty folders a migration leaves behind. Scoped to
  folders Truestill itself emptied - it never sweeps your drive - and it shows three lists before
  anything happens: what is empty, what holds only operating-system junk (`.DS_Store`,
  `Thumbs.db` and friends, removed with the folder), and what it is **leaving alone**, naming
  whatever is still inside. Anything it does not recognise keeps its folder. Removals go to the
  trash, and you type `clean` to confirm.
- **`truestill clean-empty --permanent`** - for cloud and network drives, where the trash cannot
  be used at all (there is nowhere on that mount to trash *to*). Trash is still tried first;
  only the folders it refuses are deleted outright, the preview says plainly that this is
  irreversible, and the confirmation is a different phrase - `delete forever` - so the word you
  typed for a recoverable cleanup can never be reused for a permanent one.
- **A browser end-to-end test layer** (`tests/e2e/`, `make e2e`). Playwright via
  `pytest-playwright` against an in-process app server, run in CI as its own chromium-on-ubuntu
  lane. Every UI defect the soak found is pinned as a named regression test, and the whole
  organize → back up → check journey runs as one test because the value is in the handoffs.
  Deliberately outside `make check`: a fresh clone stays green with no browser installed.
- **A hash cache** (`catalog.cache.sqlite`, beside the catalog - never inside it). An unchanged
  file is never read twice: a repeat preview of 2,275 unchanged photos went **15.8s → 4.7s**.
  It caches the perceptual hash as well as SHA-256, which is where nearly all of the win is.
  It can only ever remove work - any mismatch, corruption or unknown schema means hashing from
  scratch - so the answers are identical with it and without it.
- **`truestill --version`**, and the same version in the app footer, read from package metadata.
- **`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`** - the measured baseline per pipeline stage, the two known scaling
  limits with their thresholds, and a list of things a future optimizer should **not** "improve"
  (the size pre-filter above all). It carries one binding rule, referenced from the quality
  gates: every new pipeline stage declares its complexity in *n*, and anything worse than
  O(n log n) must justify itself.
- **A runtime alarm on the one known O(n²).** Perceptual dedup's linear scan is 0.7s at 2,275
  images and deliberately left alone; the first index to pass 10,000 now logs one line saying
  so, rather than leaving the trigger in a document nobody reads.

### Fixed
- **The Backups screen told four kinds of untruth, found in one real backup.** Checking a
  folder that was not a backup drive rendered `NaN verified · NaN missing · NaN changed`; the
  "this isn't a backup yet" state survived the copy that disproved it; the completion had no
  weight; and the drive cards said less than they knew. The NaN was a whole *class* of bug -
  handlers were reading raw job events, so every failure path could produce it - and it is
  fixed at the seam: `streamJob` now normalizes every terminal event before a handler sees it.
- **The golden path was broken at the organize → backup handoff.** Organizing never registered
  its own destination as a drive, so the app rejected the library it had just built. Organize
  destinations and backup targets are now registered on a real run (never on a preview, which
  must stay pure).
- **A path typed into one Backups field had to be typed again in the next.** Known values now
  prefill; Browse is for overriding, not for repeating yourself.
- **Organize reported "uploaded"** - backend vocabulary for an event that did not occur, and a
  quiet contradiction of the promise that files never leave the machine. Outcomes are now
  worded in exactly one place (`models.status_label`), so the CLI and the app cannot drift.
- **A cancelled run claimed there was nothing to organize.** For a 6,000-photo source, that is
  a false statement about the user's own library. Cancellation is now reported as cancellation
  on both the preview and the run paths.
- **Preview blocked the UI and could not be cancelled**; it now runs as a job on the same
  progress/SSE path as every other long operation.
- **`reclaim` can no longer delete the only copy of a file organized in place.** Such a file
  is both the source and the drive copy - one inode - so reclaim's re-verify gate was
  satisfied by the file checking against itself, and it would have deleted content with no
  backup anywhere. Those files are now excluded, and the count is reported rather than
  silently dropped.

### Removed
- **The category-first layout is decommissioned.** The compat machinery that carried existing
  libraries across to year-first - the legacy template constant, the legacy scheme, the
  load-time leniency that let a stored `{category}` template parse, and the "legacy layout"
  framing in Settings - is gone. Both real drives are year-first and verified; there are no
  external users; a bridge kept after the crossing is a path someone can still walk off.
  `{category}` is now valid **only** inside the fixed side-bin shape, which is not user-supplied.
- **The two migration undo records were retired** (The Memory Cabinet and Output, 2,269 journal
  rows each) with an explicit confirm, because after the decommission an undo would have
  succeeded into a state the product could no longer describe: a category-first tree with a
  year-first setting, and no supported way to set a matching layout. `migrate-layout --undo` on
  either drive now answers "no reversible migration exists for this drive". Reversibility itself
  is unchanged - every future migration arms its own record.

### Changed
- **The default folder layout is now year-first.** Photos land in `YYYY/YYYY-MM/`, with ordinary
  shots in a per-month `YYYY-MM - Everyday` bucket and named events in `YYYY-MM-DD - Name`
  beside it. Non-camera sources (Screenshots, WhatsApp, app names) are filed as labelled bins
  *beside* the years - `Screenshots/2024/2024-01/` - never above them. Undated files sit in
  `Undated/` at the root, or `<Label>/Undated/` for a bin.
  - **Months name themselves.** `2025-08`, not a bare `08`, so a folder still says what it is
    once it is copied, searched or attached somewhere away from its parent.
  - **Routing is on evidence, not on the label.** The one rule that identifies a camera photo
    puts it on the timeline; everything else goes to a bin. That keeps working under
    `--by-device`, where the label is the hardware name rather than `Camera`.
  - **An existing library is never reshaped.** A library organized before this change keeps its
    `<Label>/YYYY/MM/` structure, is described as a legacy layout in Settings, and is offered a
    migration it is never forced into.
  - **`{category}` is refused in a timeline template**, so source-above-timeline is structurally
    impossible rather than merely not offered. The side-bin shape is fixed and not editable.
- **Takeout metadata baking is ~27x faster.** Writing a rescued date or location into an
  organized copy spawned one `exiftool` process per file - **254.9 ms/file** measured, almost
  all of it process startup, which is about **7 hours** for a 100,000-file Takeout and 5
  minutes for a 1,200-file one. Writes are now batched (100 files per process, staged and
  baked a chunk at a time): **9.3 ms/file**, staging copy included, or ~15.6 min at 100k.
  The originals are still never touched - the batch bakes staged copies - and a process that
  dies mid-batch is **detected**, with every unconfirmed file reported failed rather than
  counted as organized.
- **The type fence now covers `scripts/`, and the pre-commit hook no longer lies.**
  `scripts/benchmark_hashing.py` imported `truestill.scan` - a module that has never existed
  under that name - and survived two renames that way, because nothing was pointed at it. It
  is repaired (correct import, no dead `sys.path` shim, the corpus read from
  `TRUESTILL_CORPUS` instead of a hard-coded home directory, and one `type: ignore` removed by
  typing the pool properly). Widening the fence also exposed that the pre-commit mypy hook
  inherited `--ignore-missing-imports`, which had been silently answering "fine" for that very
  import; it now runs with `args: []`, resolving workspace packages from source via
  `mypy_path`. That in turn revealed `uvicorn` missing from the hook's dependencies.
- **`[tool.mypy] python_version` and `[tool.ruff] target-version` raised 3.12 → 3.13**, to
  match what all three packages require and what CI actually runs.
- **The custody strip stopped doing 13x more work than it displays.** "Safe in N places" was
  building and sorting every at-risk row and then taking its length; it now counts. 224 ms →
  17.5 ms at 100,000 files, on a query that runs after every operation and on every load.
- **Renamed the project `vaeon` → `truestill`.** Distributions are now `truestill-core`,
  `truestill-cli` and `truestill-app`; the import packages are `truestill_core`,
  `truestill_cli` and `truestill_app`; the console commands are `truestill` and
  `truestill-app`; the app's auth header is `X-Truestill-Token`. The repository moved to
  `github.com/dinesh-ad/truestill`.
- Drive markers are now written as `.truestill-drive.json`. **Drives initialised before the
  rename keep working**: `.vaeon-drive.json` is still read, its `uuid`/`label`/`created` are
  preserved verbatim (the uuid is the catalog's foreign key, so re-minting would orphan every
  recorded copy), and the old file is never deleted. Reads never write; upgrading is explicit
  via `truestill drives --migrate-marker ROOT`. Precedence when both exist: the canonical
  file wins. See `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §3.1.

### Added
- Drive identity, offline catalog & verify: a `.vaeon-drive.json` marker (truestill-minted `uuid4`,
  never the mount path) identifies each backup drive. Catalog schema v6 adds a `drives` table and
  a per-(content, drive) `file_copies` location table (with a per-copy `copy_sha256`, since a
  baked copy is not byte-identical to its source). `truestill drives` (list/`--init`),
  `truestill where <term>` (which drive is a file on, fully offline), `truestill verify <path>` (re-hash a
  connected drive's copies → verified/MISSING/MISMATCH, read-only, worker-pool), and
  `truestill status` (single-copy 3-2-1 nudge). Scoped to local destinations. See
  `docs/drive-identity-research.md`.
- Google Takeout Rescue Mode (`truestill ingest --takeout <dir>`): matches each media file to its
  JSON sidecar (all naming variants -- classic, `supplemental-metadata`, truncated, `-edited`,
  relocated `(n)`), recovers `photoTakenTime`/GPS/description into the existing dating and dedup
  pipeline, bakes rescued metadata into the organized copy losslessly via exiftool (source
  untouched; catalog stores both source and post-write copy hashes), collapses album duplicate
  copies while recording album membership, and prints an honest end-of-run rescue report.
  Timezone-aware (`--tz ±HH:MM`, single UTC->local conversion), `--prefer-takeout-dates` for
  libraries fixed inside Google Photos, `--map-albums` to name Camera events after their album.
  See `docs/takeout-format.md`. Catalog schema v5.
- CLI restructured into subcommands (`truestill organize`, `truestill ingest`).
- Event layer (`--events`, opt-in, Camera-only): adaptive log-scale temporal-gap clustering
  with GPS-jump reinforcement proposes events for the user to name or skip (never
  auto-named). Named events become `Camera/YYYY/MM/YYYYMMDD_<slug>/`, consolidated under the
  start month across month boundaries. Cluster identity is the hash of member SHA-256s, so
  names and skips are remembered (schema v4) and re-proposed only when membership changes.
  Sensitivity default (4.0) tuned so multi-day trips stay whole; see `scripts/tune_events.py`.
- Filename convention: organized copies are named `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<original>` (date-only
  when the time is unknown) from the same date evidence used for placement. The prefix is
  suppressed only when that exact stamp already appears in the name, so date-embedded names
  (screenshots) are not double-dated and re-runs never stack a prefix; any mismatch keeps
  the authoritative metadata prefix. Originals are never renamed; the catalog records the
  original name alongside the new one. Disable with `--no-rename`.
- uv workspace layout: `truestill-core` (library) and `truestill-cli` (the `truestill` command),
  ready for future packages (desktop/UI) without restructuring the core.
- Concurrent hashing scan with a byte-size pre-filter (`truestill_core.scan`); thread/process
  pool selectable via `--pool`, worker count via `--workers`.
- SQLite catalog schema versioning via `PRAGMA user_version` with ordered, idempotent
  migrations; refuses catalogs written by a newer version.
- `Saved/` category for metadata-stripped social/web images (renamed from `Unsorted/`),
  plus a low-resolution + no-camera-EXIF heuristic that flags likely social saves.
- Two-tier de-duplication: exact (SHA-256) skipped, perceptual (dHash) near-duplicates
  kept-and-flagged so an original is never silently dropped for a look-alike.
- Pluggable `Destination` interface with local and rclone backends.
- Project hygiene: cross-platform CI (Linux/macOS/Windows, Python 3.13), pre-commit
  hooks (ruff + mypy), `py.typed`, package metadata, this changelog.

### Notes
- SHA-256 is the sole content hash (hardware-accelerated via OpenSSL); BLAKE3 is
  deliberately not used - one catalog column, no algorithm toggle, and a faster hash would
  optimize ~1% of cold-preview wall (`DECISIONS.md` D8; profiled 2026-07-29).
- Dates come from embedded metadata first, filename convention second, `Undated/`
  never from filesystem mtime.
