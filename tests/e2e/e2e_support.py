    (``element is not visible``, ``Page.click: Timeout 15000ms exceeded`` - the scheduled WebKit
    leg failed this way on three days). Nothing about a slower machine changes WHAT cancelling
    does, only whether the click gets there in time, so the job is held until it does.

    **How.** The app runs in this process (``boot_app``), so the job manager can be wrapped
    here. The job's worker blocks inside its progress callback on the job's own ``cancel`` event,
    the one the Cancel request sets: the job cannot finish before the cancel arrives, and once it
    does, the operation sees it at its next check, exactly as a user's cancel lands.
