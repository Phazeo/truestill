"""Harness for the browser end-to-end suite.

**Why this layer exists.** Every UI bug the soak found -- a failed job rendering "NaN
verified", two Cancel buttons wired to nothing, a stale "isn't a backup yet" message
surviving the copy that disproved it, a successful run reporting "nothing to do" -- lived in
client-side JavaScript. pytest cannot reach that layer and manual checking cannot pin it, so
each of those bugs shipped, was found by a human, and could have come back the same way.

**The server runs in-process, not as a subprocess.** ``create_app`` is a plain factory, so the
harness builds the app itself, chooses the token, and binds the socket. That removes the two
usual flake sources in this kind of fixture -- scraping a port or token out of a child's
stdout, and racing its startup -- and lets a test open the same catalog the UI is writing to,
so "the screen says 2 places" can be checked against what was actually recorded.

The cost of that choice, stated: ``__main__.py`` (port selection, argument parsing, opening a
browser) is bypassed and stays uncovered. It is uncovered today too; this suite does not
change that, and should not be read as if it did.

#: The assertion budget, raised from Playwright's 5 s default on 2026-08-15.
#:
#: ⚠ **THIS ACCOMMODATES `(ado)`'s TAIL. IT DOES NOT FIX IT.** The cause is understood and is not
#: a defect in this application: WebKit on a shared 2-core runner is simply slow in bursts, and a
#: job that reports 0.2 files/sec recovers to 1.6 and finishes. Measured over three full lanes at a
#: 60 s ceiling: **1,482 tests, zero failures to complete**, longest wait **28.4 s**. Nothing hung.
#:
#: **Why 30 and not 60.** 60 s was the probe's *ceiling*, chosen so a hang would still end the
#: test - never a target. A minute per genuinely hung assertion is too slow to fail. 30 s covers
#: everything measured with room above the 28.4 s worst case, and **anything exceeding it is a
#: finding rather than noise** - which is the property a budget has to keep to be worth having.
#:
#: **Why a ruling and not more measurement.** More samples of the lane whose tail is the thing
#: being measured cannot produce a defensible number - the tail moves with the runner. This is
#: adopted as a cost of running WebKit here, recorded once, rather than tuned forever.
#:
#: `page.set_default_timeout(15_000)` in `e2e_support.open_app` is deliberately left BELOW this
#: and is a different thing: an *action* (click, fill) that takes 15 s is broken, while *waiting
#: for the app to finish work* is what needed room. Raising both would have hidden the first.

def ui(page: Page, app_server: AppServer) -> Page:
    """The app, open and authenticated, with a short default timeout - and **loaded**.

    A low timeout costs nothing when things work and fails fast when they do not.

    `goto` resolves on the `load` event, which says nothing about the six requests the shell
    fires afterwards - `loadCustody` alone rewrites the rail, the catalog banner and five input
    fields. Every test using this fixture used to begin racing those, and the ones that noticed
    re-derived a wait of their own: `wait_for_selector(".nav-item")` at eleven sites (markup the
    server rendered, so it proves nothing about the fetches), a sleep at several more.

    **This makes every test stricter, and measurement says none of them currently need it.**
    Removing this wait leaves all 407 green (measured 2026-08-10). That is the honest state: the
    wait is insurance against a class of race, not an assertion any test's outcome rests on
    today. It costs nothing measurable - the run without it was 409s against 397s with it, which
    is variance, and in the wrong direction to be a cost.

    What proves the wait works is not this suite passing - it passed before. It is the
    differential: with a screen's load broken so it never lands, a converted test FAILS and the
    same test in its old form PASSES. A green run cannot tell those apart, which is the whole
    reason the gate for depending on this signal is a differential rather than a run count.

    The claim this docstring used to make - "every wait in these tests is an auto-retrying
    assertion, never a sleep" - was false when written: 63 `wait_for_timeout` calls across 19
    files say otherwise. It is now an aspiration with a plan behind it rather than a description,
    and it is recorded that way instead of being repeated.
