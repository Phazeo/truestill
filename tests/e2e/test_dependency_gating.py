"""Prove the browser stack never reaches a user.

Playwright is a test tool. If it -- or the ~114 MB of browser binaries behind it -- ever
appeared in a shipped wheel's dependencies, a user installing a local-first photo organizer
would silently be installing a browser engine. This asserts the claim rather than trusting the
file it is written in.

Lives with the E2E suite deliberately: it is the suite that introduced the risk, so it is the
suite that carries the proof.

    the exemption cannot quietly become a shipped dependency later.

    ⚠ **`assert "briefcase" in dev` was REMOVED here on 2026-08-15, not weakened, because its
    SUBJECT was removed.** briefcase went with the `(aad)` measurement rig - refuted, not
    abandoned: `briefcase linux system` cannot build this project at all (`3.12.3 not in
    '>=3.13'`). A presence assertion outliving the thing it asserts is worse than no assertion:
    it either fails for ever, or gets "fixed" by re-adding a dependency nothing uses. It is not
    softened to `in dev or absent`, which would pass both ways and mean nothing.

    ⚠ **And it is not replaced by `assert "briefcase" not in dev` either.** That reads like
    diligence and is the same mistake inverted: a guard standing watch over a dependency nobody
    has, failing only if someone deliberately re-adds one - at which point the reason lives in
    `(aad)`, where a reader is already going. Nothing here has an opinion about briefcase now.

    `"briefcase"` stays in `_TEST_ONLY` above, and that is not the same shape. That list is a
    DENYLIST over the shipped manifests - its corpus is those files, which are non-empty - so it
    keeps meaning something whether or not briefcase exists: it refuses a future RUNTIME
    dependency on it. This test asserted PRESENCE, which is why only this one goes.
