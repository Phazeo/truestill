"""A push onto a red or unfinished predecessor is refused. `ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` §2.

**The rule had two halves and only one was ever honoured.** §2 says *"a pending result outranks a
ready batch"*, written after three cancelled runs in one session. It carries:

* **CONTENTION** - do not push while a run is in flight, because `cancel-in-progress: true` kills
  it. Measured: 6 of 40 runs ended `cancelled`.
* **OUTCOME** - do not push again until you know the last one **passed**.

Nobody had separated them, so *"I am not cancelling anything"* read as permission. On 2026-08-21
the outcome half broke: a push went red and **two more landed on top of it**, leaving three runs
that could not be read as signals about their own commits.

§4's twenty-seventh member gives two acceptable answers - make it executable, or say plainly it
will be broken. This is the first, so the rule is tested rather than restated.

⚠ **The gate FAILS OPEN**, and these tests pin that as hard as they pin the refusal: a gate that
blocks a push on a fresh clone or with no network gets uninstalled, taking its real coverage with
it. The cry-wolf half of a guard is what keeps the guard.

⚠ **THE DECISION IS TESTED AT THE MODULE THAT MAKES IT, NOT THROUGH PATH STUBS.** The first
version wrote `#!/bin/sh` files named `gh` and `git` onto `PATH`. **Windows does not honour a
shebang**, so `gh` was simply not found, the gate correctly failed open, and six tests went red on
a lane where the product was behaving exactly as designed - `ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` §4's
thirty-ninth member, a test whose subject is an OS behaviour being a test of that OS. Patching
`_gh` on the module that owns the name is both portable and stronger: it exercises the real
decision code rather than a shell's idea of an executable.

⚠ **AND IT SAVED THE REWRITE, 2026-08-23.** `(agn)` rebuilt exactly the PATH-stub harness this
paragraph warns about - a `#!/usr/bin/env python3` file named `gh` - and would have gone red on
the Windows lane for the recorded reason. The lesson held because it was written down here rather
than remembered.

⚠ **WHAT `(agn)` CHANGED, and the fixture with it.** The gate used to derive one sha from
`git rev-parse @{upstream}` and answer both halves of §2 from it. It now takes the remote tip from
git's own `pre-push` **stdin** protocol, asks about **the branch** for contention and **that
commit** for outcome, and refuses a tip with no run instead of reading absence as success. So the
fixture supplies a ref line rather than a sha, and `_gh` returns parsed rows rather than text.

# --- a pull request's own run counts when the commit has no push run -----------------------
#
# A branch behind an open pull request is not on `main`, so CI runs for its commits as
# `pull_request`, never as `push`. The gate asked only for push runs, read "none" as UNKNOWN and
# refused every update of a pull request, green or not (seen 2026-10-31 on a tip whose pull
# request run was green). `--event push` stays the first question: it is what keeps a main tip
# from answering with the nightly run of the same sha.
