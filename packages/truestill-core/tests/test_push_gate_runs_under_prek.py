"""The INSTALLED chain judges: prek `hook-impl` -> the gate, with a real subject. P33.

⚠ **THE DEFECT, and why this file exists**: from `a173c42` (the `(agn)` rewrite) until P33 the
gate was correct and INERT - pre-commit consumes git's pre-push stdin and forwards **nothing**
(observed: a probe hook read ``stdin:[]`` while git had supplied the ref line), so the gate saw
no refs, exited 0, and pre-commit suppressed its "NOT gated" confession under ``Passed``. Two
pushes were "allowed" that were never judged, one onto a RED tip. Every prior test drove the
SCRIPT; none drove the INSTALLATION - a true answer from the unit was not the answer for the
system. These tests drive `prek hook-impl` itself, the exact process `.git/hooks/pre-push`
execs, so the transport can never silently disarm again. (The defect was found under pre-commit;
prek, which replaced it, is checked here to hand the gate the same `PRE_COMMIT_*` variables.)

**The gh-independent half runs everywhere**: the probe seam records which transport delivered
which subject, written before GitHub is ever asked. **The verdict half runs where `gh` can
answer** (this machine; CI lanes carry no auth and skip with the reason named) against two
permanent facts of this repo's history: run 32663974549 concluded FAILURE for `57d1652`, and
`6ba3948`'s run concluded SUCCESS.

**The probe branch is deliberately not `main`**: `contention()` is branch-keyed and a live run
on main at test time would flake the green case; a branch that has never had a run keeps the
contention half silently clean while `outcome()` - sha-keyed - judges the real tips.
