# truestill - Product Decisions (binding, with rationale)

Durable product decisions and the reasoning that produced them. Unlike `BACKLOG.md` (approved
but *unbuilt* work), entries here are **settled stances** that govern what truestill is - kept so the
rationale outlives chat history. Where a decision is also a binding engineering invariant, the
short form lives in `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` and this file holds the full "why".

**Decision.** truestill collects **no user accounts** and **no required telemetry**, permanently.
There is no login, no sign-up, no device identifier, no phone-home, and no usage beacon compiled
into the product. This is not a launch-phase posture that relaxes later; it is a permanent
property of what truestill is.

**Scope - what this forbids inside the product:**

- No account creation or authentication of any kind to use truestill (free **or** Pro).
- No required telemetry, analytics SDK, crash reporter, or usage ping embedded in the CLI, the
  core library, or the local web app.
- No unique identifier assigned to an install or a user.
- No network call the product makes on the user's behalf that transmits their activity. The
  product's core promise - **"your files never leave your machine"** - must hold *inside* the
  product itself, not just as marketing copy.

### How usage is measured instead (all external to the product, all aggregate)

Measurement happens **outside** the running product, from data the distribution and payment
channels already produce. None of it requires instrumenting the software:

1. **PyPI download statistics** - aggregate install counts for the published packages.
2. **GitHub signals** - stars, clones, and per-release download counts.
3. **Privacy-friendly site analytics on `truestill.app`** *(domain registered 2026-08-22; this
   line said "not yet registered" until `D16` corrected it - `(afg)` had flagged the
   contradiction and left it for the maintainer)* - a Plausible-class analytics tool: **no
   cookies, no personal data, no cross-site tracking**. Page-level aggregates only.
4. **Purchase records for Pro customers** - name / email / country, held by the **payment
   provider** as the record of a transaction. This is a payment record, not product telemetry:
   the software never sees or sends it, and it exists only because someone chose to buy.

These four give a truthful picture of adoption and revenue without a single byte of behavioral
telemetry leaving a user's machine.

### Rationale - the Audacity 2021 precedent

In 2021 Audacity's new steward proposed **opt-in** telemetry. The reaction from exactly the kind
of privacy-conscious, self-hosting audience truestill serves was decisive: roughly **3,500 downvotes**
on the proposal, **50+ forks** within days, and a permanent hostile fork (**Tenacity**) that
persists. The lesson is not "telemetry is unpopular" - it is that **for this audience, an
identity or telemetry demand converts trust directly into forks.** A tool whose entire value
proposition is "your irreplaceable files never leave your machine" cannot ask those same users to
send it their behavior; the contradiction is fatal to the trust the product runs on.

So the stance is a *product* decision, not merely a privacy nicety: it protects the single asset -
user trust - that makes a local-first media tool worth adopting.

### Future crash reporting - conditions, if ever

Should crash reporting ever be introduced, it must be **all** of:

- **Opt-in and off by default** - never enabled without an explicit, informed choice.
- **Self-hosted** - reports go to infrastructure truestill controls, never a third-party SaaS.
- **Transparent** - the exact payload is documented and inspectable before a user opts in.
- **Introduced only after community trust exists** - a post-launch, trust-has-been-earned move,
  **never shipped at launch**.

Absent all four, it does not ship.

### Pro tier without login

Pro features are gated by **offline-verified license keys** (the capability seam in
`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md §2`), **not** a login or an account. A key is verified locally; using
Pro requires no server round-trip, no sign-in, and no online activation that would leak usage.
This keeps the no-accounts invariant intact while still supporting a paid tier. (Purchase records
per item 4 live with the payment provider and are a billing artifact, not an in-product identity.)

**Status:** **Superseded by D5 (2026-07-28).** Retained as the record of the original stance.

---

## D2. Browser end-to-end tests run on the host, not in Docker

**Decision.** The E2E layer is **Playwright driven by `pytest-playwright`**, running against an
**in-process** app server on the developer's own machine and on a plain GitHub runner. **Docker
is rejected as the test substrate.**

**Why Playwright rather than Selenium or Cypress.** Auto-waiting is the deciding property:
every assertion retries until it passes or times out, which removes the `sleep` calls that are
the dominant flake source in browser suites. It drives real Chromium (not a shimmed DOM), ships
first-party trace/video capture that makes a red CI run arrive with a replay rather than a
guess, and its `pytest` plugin means the browser lane uses the same runner, fixtures and
conventions as the rest of the suite instead of introducing a second test language and a Node
toolchain. Cypress would have imported an npm build step into a project whose entire UI
architecture is *no build step* (D-adjacent: see `BACKLOG.md` (o) and the no-bundler rule).

**Why not Docker.** It was considered for hermeticity and rejected on cost/benefit:

- The thing being tested is a **local-first desktop-ish tool**. A container is a *less*
  faithful environment than the developer's own machine, not a more faithful one - it hides
  exactly the host-filesystem, mount-point and permission behaviour the product exists to
  handle.
- The real portability risk is **OS differences**, and that is already owned by the
  {ubuntu, macos, windows} Python matrix. A single Linux container would have covered less.
- Playwright's browser binaries are already version-pinned and cached in CI, which is the
  reproducibility Docker was being considered for.
- It would add a build-and-image-maintenance burden to a repo whose stated principle is to
  justify every layer with a measured need (`ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` §1).

**Status:** Settled. Mechanics and the binding lane rules in `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §6.

---

## D3. What the browser lane covers - and what it deliberately does not

**Decision.** Four scope rulings, made when the lane was built, recorded so they are not
quietly relitigated as "more coverage is better".

1. **~~Chromium on ubuntu only - no browser × OS grid.~~ REVERSED IN PART, 2026-08-14.** The
   original ruling read: *"this lane owns client-side truth, which for a vanilla-JS app with no
   build step and no framework runtime is browser-uniform enough that a grid would buy coverage
   there is no evidence we need. Revisit on evidence - a real cross-browser bug - and not
   before."*

   **The evidence it asked for arrived, and so did the reason its premise expired.** `(9cdd85d)`
   added WebKit because **WebKit is the engine the Tauri shell renders in on Linux and macOS** -
   a chromium-only lane was silent about the browser that ships, which is a stronger argument
   than any single cross-browser bug. And the premise itself is now false twice over: the app is
   not no-build (`make e2e` depends on `make frontend`, which runs `tsc --noEmit && vite build`)
   and not framework-free (a React island owns `#org-result`).

   **What stands:** one operating system in this lane. The OS axis is still the Python matrix's
   job, and widening it still waits on a real cross-OS browser bug.
2. **Fixtures are generated, never committed.** Media files do not belong in git whatever their
   provenance; a committed generator (`tests/e2e/conftest.py`) builds exactly the corpus each
   test needs. This also keeps the personal corpus out of the repo permanently.
3. **No in-place-organize E2E.** The feature is CLI-only by decision
   (`BACKLOG.md`, app-surface deferrals), so there is no UI to drive; asserting it through a
   browser would test a surface that does not exist.

   > **⚠ PREMISE SUPERSEDED (2026-07-30) by `(eee)`, now in `SHIPPED.md`.** The ruling above is kept
   > unedited because it was **correct when it was made**: the app had no in-place surface, and
   > an e2e for it would have asserted against nothing. `(eee)` then shipped Copy / Move /
   > Reorganize-in-place as radio options (`templates/index.html`), which removed the premise
   > rather than reversing the reasoning. `tests/e2e/test_ui_regressions.py` now drives that
   > surface, correctly.
   >
   > **What survives is the rule, not the verdict:** the browser lane covers a surface that
   > exists and does not invent coverage for one that does not. Applied to today's app, that
   > same rule produces the opposite answer. Note the deferral this ruling cites has moved on
   > too - `reclaim` is now the only thing still CLI-only, so a `reclaim` e2e would be the
   > current instance of the mistake this ruling was written to prevent.
4. **One golden path as a single long journey, not six tests.** The value is in the *handoffs* -
   state carried from organize to Backups, a library the app registered being accepted by the
   copy flow. Split into six set-up tests, the defect that actually shipped (organize never
   registering its own destination) would have passed all six.

**Status:** Settled. Rules in `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §6; the journey itself is
`tests/e2e/test_golden_path.py`.

---

## D4. Batched exiftool writes use an argfile, not a persistent process

**Decision.** The Takeout metadata bake batches through an **argfile with `-execute`
separators** (`exif.write_metadata_batch`). exiftool's `-stay_open True -@ -` persistent-process
mode was measured, compared, and **not adopted**.

**The measurement** (300 files, then confirmed at 1,203):

| approach | per file | vs today |
|---|---|---|
| one process per file (what shipped before) | 225–255 ms |- |
| argfile batch | 5.2 ms | ~43× |
| `-stay_open` persistent process | 4.6 ms | ~48× |

**The rationale is the TCO rule, applied literally.** `-stay_open` is **1.12× on top of a 27×
win** end to end. What that 1.12× costs is a persistent child process, a reader thread, timeout
handling and a lifecycle state machine with a mid-batch-death mode - on **the one code path in
the product that modifies bytes the user keeps**. A component earns its place by solving a
problem you can point at (`ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` §1); 12% on a stage that is no longer the
bottleneck is not that problem.

This decision was flagged to the user as a deviation from a stated preference *before* it
shipped, and **ratified** on the measurement.

**The known next rung, if the batch ever proves insufficient:** `-stay_open` remains the
correct escalation and is recorded as such in `PERFORMANCE.md`. It gets built when evidence
says the argfile batch is the bottleneck - decided by measurement then, not by machinery now.

**Status:** Settled. Performance contract and failure-mode rules in
`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §8; the numbers in `PERFORMANCE.md` §1.

---

## D5. Accounts, activation, and the licensing server

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-07-28).** truestill **requires a user account**. It supersedes D1.
Nothing of the **server** is built yet: this is post-launch work, and the licensing server is new
infrastructure that gets its own research and design pass before any of it is written. The
client account screen, routes and rail slot already exist; they wait on that server.

### 1. How it works

- **An account is created at activation**, against a **self-hosted licensing server** (Hetzner).
  Email is verified at signup.
- The app receives a **signed local token** and **runs fully offline thereafter**. Activation is
  **one-time**; there is no per-launch phone-home and no periodic revalidation.
- **Photo data never leaves the machine.** Nothing about a user's library - not filenames, not
  counts, not hashes - is transmitted at activation or afterwards.
- The public framing is **"an account for the software, never for your data."** That sentence is
  only honest while the previous bullet is true, so it is a constraint on the build, not copy.

**The account provides:** license and key management, update entitlement, and the upgrade path.

**Marketing:** periodic email to all registered users, free and paid, carrying upgrade offers.
Unsubscribe is honoured. **EU consent is captured at signup**, and GDPR obligations attach to
the account data from day one - it is personal data held on infrastructure truestill controls.

**Key-sharing control:** activation counts per account are monitored server-side.

### 2. Monetization

Recorded in full as **D6**, as revised by **D18** (2026-09-14): yearly subscription with a
perpetual fallback on the last paid version.

### 3. What this changes in the product

The no-accounts invariant in `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §1 is rewritten to match, and the
offline-verified-key mechanism described there becomes *token-after-activation* rather than
*key-with-no-server*. The capability seam (§2) is unaffected - it was always the right shape for
gating, whatever verifies the entitlement.

### 4. The engineering recommendation, recorded at the maintainer's instruction

**The recommendation was against requiring an account**, and it is recorded here rather than
dropped, because a decision is easier to revisit when the case against it is written down next
to it.

The argument: D1's rationale was not privacy sentiment, it was the **Audacity 2021 precedent** -
for this specific audience, self-hosting and data-hoarding users, an identity requirement
converts trust into forks. That audience is also the one most likely to notice that a local-first
photo tool now has a signup screen, and least likely to accept "the account is only for the
software" without checking. The reputational cost lands hardest at exactly the launch moment
when there is no track record to weigh against it.

There are also two concrete costs the design has to carry: **truestill now holds personal data**
(emails, activation records) with the GDPR duties, breach exposure and deletion obligations that
follow, and **the licensing server becomes a single point of failure for activation** - if it is
down, unreachable, or eventually shut down, new installs cannot activate. An offline key scheme
had neither property.

**The counter-arguments, stated fairly:** a perpetual-licence-plus-updates business genuinely
needs an entitlement record and a way to reach customers about renewals, and offline keys make
both awkward; one-time activation is a far smaller ask than a login-per-launch and is
commonplace in paid desktop software; and self-hosting the server keeps the data under
truestill's control rather than a third party's.

**Ruling: accounts are required.** The mitigations that make it defensible are already in the
design above and are binding, not optional: one-time activation, no per-launch phone-home,
**no photo data transmitted ever**, self-hosted infrastructure, honoured unsubscribe, and
explicit EU consent.

### 5. Before any of it is built

The licensing server is new infrastructure and gets its **own research and design pass**:
authentication, the **user database**, GDPR data handling (lawful basis, retention, export,
deletion), **backups**, and **uptime** - an activation endpoint that is down is a storefront
that cannot sell, so its availability target is a product decision rather than an ops detail. **Deliverable: an offline-activation fallback story**, decided in that pass - what a
user does when the server is unreachable, and what happens to activated installs if it is ever
retired. That question is the one most likely to be regretted if it is left until after launch.

**Status:** Settled as a decision. Client activation UI and `/api/account*` exist; the licensing
server and payment remain unbuilt. Supersedes D1.

---

## D6. Monetization: perpetual licence, paid annual updates

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-07-28).** Supersedes the earlier "one-time Pro licence" sketch.
Post-launch; nothing built.

### 1. The model (Sublime Text / JetBrains shape)

⚠ **SUPERSEDED 2026-09-14 BY `D18`.** The bullets below are the 2026-07-28 wording. What survives
unchanged is the property in the paragraph under them: **a lapsed entitlement still works** -
what lapses is new versions, never access to the library or to the build already paid for. D18
keeps that property and changes the commercial shape from pay-once to yearly subscription with
a perpetual fallback (JetBrains' model, named as the precedent). Read D18 for the current rule,
the price, and why annual-only.

- **Pay once, own that version forever.** A licence never expires and never stops working.
- **One year of updates included** from purchase.
- **Renewal at roughly 40-50% of full price** continues updates for another year.
- **Pricing figures are deliberately TBD post-launch** - set them against real adoption rather
  than a guess made before anyone has used the thing.

The property that makes this the right shape for truestill: **a lapsed licence still works.** A
tool that holds someone's photo library must never become a hostage to a missed renewal, and a
subscription that stops opening a library would contradict the custody promise the whole product
rests on. What lapses is *new versions*, not access to your own files.

⚠ **`D16` (2026-09-11) CONFIRMED THIS SECTION'S PROPERTY and records a framing it refused:** that a
lapsed licence might open, find, browse and export but not organize. Organizing is the core
function, so that would be a licence that stopped working, which is the sentence above. A lapsed
licence loses nothing it bought. **`D18` (2026-09-14) keeps that property under yearly billing.**

### 2. Keys are signed, not generated

⚠ **THE MECHANISM HERE IS SUPERSEDED - read `D5` §3 first.** This section describes
key-with-no-server, and `D5` §3 replaced it with **token-after-activation** on 2026-07-28. It
carried no note saying so until `D16`, so it read as current for six weeks. **What survives the
change is the payload decision below** - Ed25519, name and email embedded, deterrence by identity
- which is exactly as true of a token as it was of a key.

Licence keys are **Ed25519-signed**, with the **buyer's name and email embedded** in the payload.

Two properties follow, and both matter more than obfuscation would:

- **Keygen-proof.** A signature cannot be forged without the private key, so there is no
  algorithm to reverse-engineer. This is why signing beats any scheme built on a secret format.
- **Share-deterrent by identity, not by lockout.** A shared key carries the sharer's own name and
  email. That is a social deterrent rather than a technical restriction, which is deliberate:
  it costs an honest user nothing, and it never risks locking out someone who has paid.

Verification is local against the embedded public key. Combined with D5's activation-count
monitoring, this gives two independent signals about sharing without either one gating a
legitimate user mid-session.

### 3. Asking for money: visible, never gates

**The rule: truestill asks visibly and often enough to be heard, and never withholds function to
force the question.**

This comes from the maintainer's own twenty years as a free user of other people's software - *"no one
ever asked me to pay"*. The failure mode being designed against is not piracy; it is the honest
user who would happily have paid and was simply never asked.

The asks, all non-blocking:

- a note on the **about screen**;
- a **post-completion line** mentioning Pro after a run finishes - the moment the tool has just
  demonstrably helped;
- a **voluntary newsletter** signup on the site;
- **release notes that name** which additions are Pro.

**What is never done:** a nag on launch, a countdown, a modal that must be dismissed, a
degraded free experience, or any feature that stops working to make a point. A gate would
contradict D5's framing of an account "for the software, never for your data" - the same
instinct applies to function.

⚠ **`D16` DECIDES HOW THE FREE TIER IS SHAPED SO THAT THIS PARAGRAPH STAYS TRUE**: a cumulative
cap on files **written**, never a feature lock. Nothing stops working at any count.

### 4. No trial. Free tier forever. (2026-08-01, revises the framing above)

**Decision.** truestill has **no time-limited trial**. There is a **free tier that does not
expire**.

The reasoning is specific to this product rather than borrowed from SaaS practice: **truestill
is a job, not a habit.** The user's real task - organise a lifetime of photos - is a *one-time
event*. A 14-day or 30-day trial is therefore not a taste of the product; it is **exactly long
enough to finish the job and leave**. The trial would hand over the entire value and then ask
for money for something the user no longer needs. A free tier that never expires at least keeps
the relationship alive for the part that recurs.

That sharpens the Pro question rather than answering it, so it is recorded as the open question
it is.

**OPEN: what does someone buy AFTER the big job is done?** Three candidate answers, none chosen:

1. **Sell what RECURS.** Free organises the library once; Pro keeps it safe over years - ongoing
   intake of new photos, backup verification, drive health. This is the answer that fits
   "one-time job" most directly: the job ends, the custody does not.
2. **Sell CONFIDENCE at the irreversible moment.** Both existing Pro candidates already have
   this shape - `BACKLOG.md` **(p)** "share safely" (metadata-stripping export, already marked
   PRO TIER) and **(m)** duplicate review with quality ranking. Each is *"I am about to do
   something I cannot undo"*, which is when people pay.
3. **Sell SCALE.** Free handles a normal library; Pro handles the hoarder's.

A fourth candidate shape, from market observation rather than principle: **meter by RATE, not by
feature.** FocusClean allows "100 photos free each month" - the core works *completely* and only
volume is limited. Recorded because it is **compatible with the boundary below in a way
feature-gating is not**: nothing is withheld, nothing is crippled, and the user can always
finish what they started at a slower pace.

⚠ **CHOSEN, 2026-09-11: the fourth candidate, as a CUMULATIVE lifetime cap rather than a monthly
rate.** `D16` is the ruling and carries the reasoning, the starting number and why it is low. The
first three candidates are not refused - they remain open shapes for what Pro *adds* - but the
free/Pro **line** is no longer an open question.

**THE BOUNDARY, which does not move: do not cripple the core organiser.** If free cannot be
trusted with a user's photos, **Pro cannot either** - trust is the product, and a hobbled free
tier sells against the thing being sold. This also restates §3 above from the other side: §3
forbids withholding function to force the question; this forbids designing the free tier as the
withholding.

**The anti-pattern that defines the boundary more sharply than the boundary does.**
Photobucket locked users out of **their own photos** and then charged to retrieve them one at a
time. The "mass exodus of 2017" is still cited in reviews years later - the reputational damage
outlived the revenue by a decade. So the line is not merely *"do not cripple free"*:

> **Nothing behind the paywall may ever stand between a user and their own files.**
> Export, retrieval, and reading the catalog stay free **permanently**, whatever else Pro
> becomes.

**Price anchors - anchors, not conclusions.** Comparable shipping products, gathered 2026-08-01:

| Product | Model | Price |
|---|---|---|
| ImageSlip (sorts photos into folders) | pay-once | $5 |
| Gallery Sort | freemium, pay-once | $18 |
| ACDSee | licence | $60-150 |
| FotoStation | licence | $159-459 |

The previously recorded **$29-39** sits between the swipe-sorters and the professional DAMs,
which is the right neighbourhood for a custody tool. These are **anchors for judgement, not a
derivation of the price.**

**The research gap, recorded honestly.** Two searches for *users saying why they paid* returned
**vendor directories, not user voices**. So the price anchors above are real and the
**motivation evidence is not yet gathered** - what exists is inference from product listings,
which is not the same thing and must not be cited as if it were.

**The soak is the better instrument.** Real users asking real questions will show what they
would pay for far more reliably than inference from a listing. **The free/Pro split should not
be decided before then**, and pricing and the final split stay post-launch regardless.

**Status:** Settled as a decision, unbuilt. Supersedes the one-time Pro-licence sketch;
the capability seam (`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §2) is where Pro features attach.
§4 revises the framing: no trial, free tier forever.
⚠ **Partly superseded by `D16` (2026-09-11)**: the free/Pro split is no longer open - it is a
cumulative cap on files written. §2's *mechanism* was superseded by `D5` §3; its payload decision
stands. ⚠ **§1's pay-once commercial shape is superseded by `D18` (2026-09-14)** - yearly
subscription with perpetual fallback; the property that a lapsed entitlement still works is what
survives.

---

## D7. Source licence: Apache-2.0, open-core

**Decision.** The truestill source published in this repository is **Apache License 2.0**.
The commercial shape is **open-core**: the open tree is the product; paid Pro capabilities
(D6) attach through the capability seam (`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §2) rather than a
separate closed codebase.

**What this binds:**

- Root `LICENSE` is the Apache-2.0 text; package metadata (`license = "Apache-2.0"`) matches.
- Copyright line: `Copyright 2026 Dinesh A`.
- No copyleft (GPL-family) dependency may be introduced into the published packages without an
  explicit superseding decision - Apache-2.0 + open-core is incompatible with that surprise.
- Open-core does **not** mean a free/crippled build and a proprietary build of the same tree.
  Pro is entitlement and gating (D5/D6), not a second source licence.

**Status:** Superseded by D22 (2026-11-05). Recorded here because the packages already shipped
`Apache-2.0` and the root `LICENSE` existed; the stance itself had not been written into this
file.

---

## D8. Content hash is SHA-256 - BLAKE3 is deliberately absent

**Decision.** The sole content hash is **SHA-256** (`hashlib`). There is no BLAKE3 dependency,
no dual-hash catalog column, and no user-facing algorithm toggle.

**Corrected rationale (2026-07-29).** An earlier recorded reason claimed BLAKE3 was rejected
because it is a compiled dependency that must build across platforms. That is **overstated**:
the `blake3` PyPI package ships prebuilt wheels for most environments and needs no Rust
toolchain for typical users. That argument is withdrawn.

**The measured reason, which is stronger** (`docs/preview-performance-profile.md`, historical
Wayanad '14 on `Photos/Archive` - now OFF LIMITS to re-run; 2,064 files, cold cloud-mount preview):

- SHA-256 ran on **22 of 2,064 files** (~1% after the size pre-filter) and offers about
  **1.03×** headroom if it went to zero.
- **exiftool is 74%** of that wall; unconditional perceptual hashing is most of the rest.
- A faster hash therefore optimizes the **1%**. It is the wrong axis.

Also: BLAKE3's headline speedup comes from **multithreading within a single file**, and it can
be slower than SHA-256 on inputs below ~1 MB. truestill already parallelizes **across files**
(`scan.compute_hashes`), which is the correct axis for this library-sized workload.

**Reasons that remain valid:**

- **One hash type in the catalog** - `files.sha256` / `file_copies` are keyed on a single
  algorithm. Introducing BLAKE3 would mean a dual-hash migration or a rewrite of identity.
- **No user-facing algorithm toggle** - one catalog column, one verification identity, no
  setting that splits a library's custody record.

**Status:** Settled. Short form in `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` § dependency inventory.

---

## D9. Launch on Windows and Linux. macOS builds but is not published.

**Decision (2026-08-01, maintainer's ruling).** truestill launches on **Windows and Linux only**,
with **no code-signing certificate purchased - zero spend now**. macOS **continues to build in
CI**: the lane stays, the tests stay, and nothing about macOS support is removed from the code.
It is simply not published.

**Why macOS is built but not shipped.** Gatekeeper blocks unsigned applications outright - not a
warning with a way through, a refusal - and the only way around it is the **$99/yr Apple
Developer account**. Shipping an unsigned `.dmg` would mean shipping something most users
physically cannot open. Dropping the lane instead would be worse: macOS support would rot
silently, and the cost of noticing would land on whoever eventually pays the $99 and finds the
platform has been broken for months. Building without publishing keeps it honest and cheap.

### What "unsigned" actually costs, per platform

Recorded because it is the whole basis of the ruling, and because "unsigned" is usually treated
as one condition when it is three different ones:

- **Linux: no gate at all.** Nothing to sign, nothing to warn about. AppImage and `.deb` install
  and run. This platform costs nothing and is not affected by any of the below.
- **Windows: SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC" / unrecognized app**, with a **hidden
  "Run anyway"** behind *More info*. It is **reputation-based per file**, and it **clears** once
  enough people download and run that file - one maintainer reports the threshold falling
  somewhere between a few dozen and a few hundred downloads. It is a **friction that expires**,
  not a block and not a permanent state.
- **Signing does not fully remove it either.** A standard (non-EV) certificate still warns until
  reputation accrues; it only accrues *faster*. Only an **EV certificate** or **Microsoft Store**
  distribution removes the warning immediately. So the honest comparison is not
  "warning vs no warning" - it is "warning for a while vs warning for a shorter while, for
  money".
- **This is a normal position, not a corner.** Inkscape and many established open-source projects
  ship unsigned. The precedent is broad enough that it carries no signal about product quality.

### The cheap paths back, so they are not re-researched

Recorded with what is **verified** separated from what is **reported**, because the point of
writing them down is that the next person does not repeat the search:

- **Azure Artifact Signing** - Microsoft's own service, and **the one to evaluate first** if
  signing is ever bought. **Note the rename:** it was called *Azure Trusted Signing* and is now
  **Azure Artifact Signing**; searching the old name in future will find stale pages. Verified
  2026-08-01: **$9.99/month** for the Basic tier (5,000 signatures/month, one certificate
  profile), **$99.99/month** for Premium - so **~$120/yr**, which confirms the figure this
  ruling was made on. Reported, not verified here: **no hardware token**, and direct **GitHub
  Actions** integration. Cheaper than the $300-700/yr commonly quoted for EV certificates.
  Caveat for whoever evaluates it: Microsoft's own pricing page rendered its tiers as
  placeholders when fetched directly, so confirm against the Azure portal for the actual region.
- **Microsoft Store with an MSIX** - **Microsoft re-signs automatically**, so users never see
  SmartScreen at all, and the certificate costs nothing. Worth evaluating **on its own terms
  rather than as a signing workaround**, because it also changes distribution: discovery,
  updates, and the payment path all move, and `D6`'s perpetual-licence model would have to be
  reconciled with Store policy before this is a real option.

### Requirement carried to the launch page

**Windows users must be told what SmartScreen will show, and why, BEFORE they download.** Plain
language, on the download page, above the button - not in a FAQ and not after the fact.

The reason this is a requirement rather than a nicety: truestill is sold on **trust with
someone's irreplaceable photos**. A user who meets an unexplained "unrecognized app" warning on
*that* product draws exactly the wrong conclusion, and they draw it at the moment they were about
to install. Telling them first converts the same warning from **alarming to expected** - and a
warning the page predicted accurately is evidence the product is what it says it is.

**Status:** Settled. **This unblocks `(aad)`**: the bundler decision can be made for Windows and
Linux alone, with no signing step in the pipeline.

**Decided 2026-08-21**, after research rather than preference. The upgrade was raised as the first
non-defect change in weeks; it is not blocked by anything, and nothing argues for it.

### Nothing breaks - that is not the same as a reason to move

Every runtime and dev dependency resolves on 3.14 and ships **cp314 wheels on all three lanes**
(numpy, pillow, pillow-heif, scipy, pywavelets); the rest are pure-python or `py3-none-<platform>`.
PyInstaller has supported 3.14 since **6.15.0 (2025-08-03)** and declares `<3.16,>=3.8`. The whole
suite passes locally on 3.14.4 (2,664 passed). `uv.lock` already admits 3.14 unchanged.

### Why we are not moving

- **No support pressure.** 3.13 is in *bugfix* status until **October 2029**
  ([devguide](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)).
- **3.15 lands 2026-10-01**, so moving now buys about six weeks of being *n-1*.
- **Nothing in 3.14 is wanted.** Free-threading is unused; `pathlib.Path.copy/move` would mean
  rewriting safety-critical `safe_copy.py`; the hot path is C (`hashlib`, Pillow decode).
- ⚠ **`sys.flags.context_aware_warnings` is `0`** on non-free-threaded 3.14 - measured. The
  contextvar `catch_warnings` does **not** arrive by upgrading, so `(aev)`'s `decode_noise` is
  necessary on both versions. **The upgrade fixes nothing we have fixed**, and must never be
  justified by it.
- §13 prefers boring technology when it is sufficient. 3.13 is sufficient.

### Two things 3.14 would change, and one of them is a defect

- **`multiprocessing` defaults to `forkserver` on Linux** (was `fork`) - measured on both
  interpreters here. `--pool process` is a user-facing flag, so its Linux behaviour changes.
  `scan.py` already passes `initializer=`, so it is correct **by design, not by luck** - it was
  written for spawn. `verify.py`'s pool hashes only and needs nothing.
- ⚠ **`(aey)`**: `Path.is_dir()`/`exists()`/`is_file()` stop raising on `EACCES`, so
  `path_probe.probe_dir` would report an unreadable folder as **missing and creatable** - the
  module's whole purpose inverted - and its guard **skips rather than fails**. The concrete
  blocker. ⚠ **Corrected 2026-08-21 after grepping rather than assuming: it is FIVE sites, not
  one.** `destinations/local.py:LocalDestination.local_root` deliberately raises and would stop;
  `service/date_rescue.py:original_candidates`
  and `drive_adoption.py:_inspect_one` each guard it. ⚠ **Corrected 2026-08-23 during a documentation
  audit**: this said `:167` and claimed *both* sites *"carry a comment stating the rule"*, quoting
  *"cannot look, which is not 'nothing there'"* and *"not evidence either way"*. The first is real
  and still at `service/date_rescue.py:original_candidates`; the second **is no longer in the source** - the guard
  there is a bare `except OSError: continue`, and the wording now survives only in
  `test_refused_is_never_absent.py:test_a_refused_sample_is_not_evidence_that_a_drive_is_not_the_library`, which quotes it. **The behaviour is unchanged and the
  decision stands**; what was stale is the evidence offered for it, which is worth more than the
  sentence reading tidily. The deletion path (`reclaim.py`)
  was checked and **fails safe on both versions**. 3.14 did not invent this: its `is_dir()` is
  `return os.path.isdir(self)`, and `os.path` has always swallowed `OSError` - pathlib was the
  outlier we relied on. `Path.stat()` still raises on both and is the remedy.

### What moves the decision

Any one of: **3.15 ships and settles** (3.13 becomes *n-2*); a dependency drops 3.13; or a defect
we cannot fix on 3.13 is fixed upstream. `(aey)` must be closed first regardless.

### The CI leg

3.14 is a `continue-on-error` matrix dimension of the **one** check job - never a second lane.
⚠ **It reports green through `(aey)` today**, which is exactly why it is evidence and cannot be
promoted to a gate until that entry closes.

**Status:** Settled until one of the conditions above fires. **No tag was cut**: the release lane
is exercised with `workflow_dispatch` + `dry_run=true`, and a `v*` tag is the *publish* trigger,
not a dry run (`release.yml`).

> ⚠ **Corrected 2026-09-04 (P208), beside rather than in the frozen text above.** Two things.
>
> **The claim is overtaken**: `v0.1.0` (2026-08-30) and `v0.1.1` (2026-09-03) were both tagged and
> published. `git ls-remote --tags origin` and `gh release list` are the check. The sentence was
> true when D10 was written and the trigger it describes is unchanged - what expired is *"no tag
> was cut"*. This is a **fifth** copy of the class P204 swept for and closed; that sweep matched
> the wording *"the publish job has never run"* and this says it differently, which is `(aka)`'s
> point about a pathspec exactly one level up - a sweep is only as wide as the phrasing it guesses.
>
> **The citation was repointed** to the file alone, from a line number in `release.yml` - and it
> was wrong before it was stale: that line held the `.deb` step's `compare_selfcheck.py` call,
> which has nothing to do with which trigger publishes. It resolved, so `test_live_documents_cite_code_that_exists.py`
> passed it for as long as it existed - the measured `(ago)` failure, in this document. A `.yml`
> has no citable symbol (`cite_symbols.py:symbols`), so the file alone is the durable form.

## D11. Stay on mypy - and the condition that would change it, restated so it can fire

**Decided 2026-08-21**, replacing a trigger in
[`frontend-and-shell-standard-research.md`](frontend-and-shell-standard-research.md) that named
the wrong tool. That file is a record and keeps its original wording; this is the live version.

**The decision is unchanged: mypy strict, in the gate.** The reason is not that the alternatives
are bad - two of them are better on the axis they compete on - it is that **the axis does not
matter here**. mypy is invisible in every lane's wall clock (`PERFORMANCE.md` §5.1: Windows is
1,638 s of summed test time, ubuntu 121 s; mypy appears in neither). A checker 10-50x faster
saves nothing a person can perceive.

### What actually changed, recorded so the decision rests on current facts

| | May 2026 (as recorded) | 2026-08-21 |
|---|---|---|
| **Pyrefly** | *"58% and 87.8%, disputed"* | **1.0 stable since May 2026**, ~92.2% conformance, deployed at Meta (Instagram, PyTorch, JAX) |
| **`ty`** | *"15% and 53.2%", beta, no plugins* | **still alpha** - not for production CI |
| **mypy** | the incumbent | ~59.6% conformance |

⚠ **The old trigger read *"revisit when `ty` reaches stable 1.0"*, and `ty` is the one that did
not move.** A condition aimed at the wrong subject is a condition that never fires, which is worse
than none: it looks like the question is being watched.

### The trigger, restated

Revisit when **any** of these is true, and the first two name Pyrefly because Pyrefly is what moved:

1. **mypy becomes visible in a lane's wall clock** - the original and still the only reason that
   would force the change on its own.
2. **Pyrefly ships something mypy cannot do that this repo needs**, rather than doing the same
   thing faster. Conformance percentage is not that; a rule we want and cannot express is.
3. **mypy stops being maintained**, or drops a Python version this project runs.

**Cheap and unblocked meanwhile:** a second checker in **advisory** mode produces evidence instead
of argument, the way the 3.14 lane does for the interpreter (D10). Nobody has run it.

**Governance note, carried forward:** uv, ruff and `ty` are all Astral, and Astral joined OpenAI in
March 2026. Three of four toolchain tools under one owner is worth knowing - not a reason to act,
since all are permissively licensed and forkable, but a reason not to add the fourth without
noticing.

## D12. Aceternity UI is refused - recorded because it was decided and never written down

**Decided in conversation before 2026-08-21; written down 2026-08-21 after an audit found it was
nowhere in the repository.** `grep -ri aceternity` returned nothing. The decision was being
honoured by memory alone.

**Refused on two grounds, both verified rather than remembered:**

1. **It requires Motion (Framer Motion).** Aceternity is a Tailwind **+ Motion** library; the
   animation dependency is not optional to it. Truestill's UI has no animation requirement, and
   `(adi)`'s React island exists to render a result grid, not to move.
2. **The bundle cost is real and is paid by a local app that has no reason to pay it.** Motion is
   ~34 kB gzipped standalone and adds **~125 kB** in practice; trimming to ~4.6 kB needs explicit
   `LazyMotion` configuration that is easy to skip and easy to regress. The app is served from
   localhost by the user's own machine, so the cost is startup and memory rather than network -
   which makes it cheaper to dismiss and no less real.

**What this does NOT rest on.** Not taste, not "we do not need a component library" - shadcn
components are already in `src/components/ui/`. The refusal is specific to a library whose value
is animation, in a product with none.

**Status:** Settled. Revisit only if the product acquires a genuine motion requirement - and then
the question is Motion itself, not Aceternity, since Aceternity is a set of components built on it.
**Scope, stated 2026-09-02 (P192):** the refusal is for `truestill-app`, whose seven screens are
forms, tables and result cards. A landing page is the category such a library exists for
(`brand.md` §6 assigns the public artwork to `truestill.app`; `(afg)` records that the page has no
home here), and this decision says nothing about one.

---

## D13. Python 3.14 is adopted - and D10's deferral was correct reasoning from a wrong number

**Decided 2026-08-22**, reversing [D10](#d10-python-314-is-deferred-and-the-ci-leg-is-evidence-rather-than-a-target).
D10 is corrected in place and left standing; this is what replaced it.

### Why the deferral fell

D10's P1 said *"3.13 is in full bugfix support for four more years"* and cited **October 2029**.
That is 3.13's **security** EOL. The devguide's *"end of life"* column is *"five years after a
release"*, and its status key reads: **"Security: After two years… only security fixes are
accepted and no more binaries are released."** 3.13 shipped 2024-10-07, so **bugfix support ends
around October 2026**.

⚠ **"No more binaries are released" is the operative half for this project**, which installs
interpreters with `uv python install` and ships a PyInstaller build. A security-only branch stops
producing the artefacts the whole toolchain consumes.

⚠ **The reasoning was sound; the premise was false.** Everything else in D10 held on re-reading:
the alternatives were correctly judged, `sys.flags.context_aware_warnings` really is `0`,
`(aey)` really was the blocker and is now closed. **That is the fifty-eighth member from the other
direction** - a written claim, checkable, and therefore caught. A deferral held in conversation
would have quietly expired.

### What made this a bump rather than a gamble

D10 ordered the evidence and the evidence arrived: cp314 wheels on all three platforms for every
pin, `uv.lock` needing **no change** to admit 3.14, and the **3.14 legs green on every run** from
the day they were added. The relock moved **no package version at all**. The condition every 2026
source names for an existing project - *upgrade when your dependencies are ready* - was measured
met before it was acted on.

### What actually changed, and what did not

- ⚠ **`multiprocessing` defaults to `forkserver` on Linux**, so `--pool process` behaves
  differently. Measured on the format corpus: **thread and process agree exactly on both
  interpreters**, and exact deduplication was identical across all four runs. `scan.py` was
  correct for forkserver by design, having been written for spawn.
- ⚠ **One extra near-duplicate** - 262 on 3.13, 263 on 3.14. Filed as `(aff)`; the mechanism is
  **not isolated**, and a near-duplicate is kept and flagged rather than removed, so the effect is
  one extra row in a review list.
- ⚠ **PEP 758 is deliberately NOT adopted yet.** Moving ruff's `target-version` to `py314` makes
  the formatter rewrite `except (A, B):` into `except A, B:` across **25 files** - syntax that is
  a `SyntaxError` on 3.13. That is a language migration, and bundling it into the floor bump would
  have made the bump unrevertible. `target-version` stays `py313` until it gets its own commit.

**Status:** Adopted. The next question is 3.15 (2026-10-01), and the machinery for judging it is
already in place: an allowed-to-fail matrix leg, which is why it was kept rather than deleted.

## D14. The organize preview resolves once, unscoped, and re-judges for the promise

**Decided 2026-09-05**, from a defect found by using the product: a source already organized into
one folder, previewed against a fresh second folder, was promised *"0 files will be organized ...
259 of 260 files here are already in your library"*, and the run past the gate wrote every file.

### Two rulings, both binding, that pulled the preview apart

- `(aei)`: dedup is scoped **per destination**, never per catalog. A twin the library holds on X is
  not a duplicate for a run into Y; it is the second copy the run exists to make. The run has
  honoured this since `(aei)` shipped, through `service/organize._scope_to_marker`.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §9, *"A preview that finds almost everything already in the
  library says so, names WHICH library, and points at rearranging"*: the preview must report that
  the library already holds these files, on which drive, and offer to rearrange rather than
  re-copy. That report is derived from the catalog-global matches.

Scoping the preview's single `resolve` to the destination - the one-argument fix, tried and
measured 2026-09-05 - makes the promise true and empties the naming: `_matched_drives` reads the
exact matches, and a scoped pass returns no match for a twin absent from this destination. Four
tests in `test_the_preview_names_the_drive.py` go red. The two rulings cannot both hold on one
answer.

### The shape: one pass, two derived answers

`organize_preview` resolves **once, catalog-global**. Those matches feed `matched_drives`,
`exact_dup_matches` and the rearrange pointer, unchanged. Then `_promise_view` re-judges each
exact match against this destination with the same function the run uses,
`organizer._scope_to_destination`, over `_scope_to_marker(destination, catalog)`, in the run's
order, with the run's `landing_here`. The tally and `will_organize` come from that view. The card
can therefore say *"3 of 3 files here are already in your library on Library"* and *"3 files will
be organized into Library2"* in one breath, because both are true.

**Not two resolves.** The re-judgement is a pass over verdicts already made; nothing is hashed or
matched again, so preview cost is unchanged and the two answers cannot drift from one another.

### The direction of travel, not taken now

restic implements `--dry-run` as an overlay backend that accepts writes without forwarding them:
the dry run **is** the run, so the two cannot disagree, and its output reports both a file's known
status and what would actually be written. Truestill's preview and run are two code paths that
drifted once already. The overlay shape - the preview executing the run's own decision path
against a destination that records instead of writes - is where this should go; it is a refactor
of `organize_run`'s loop and is not attempted here.


## D15. Glass is for CHROME ONLY, it is built without `backdrop-filter`, and no library may supply it

**Decided 2026-09-06.** Recorded because it has been argued twice from taste and would be argued
again the first time someone opens a component gallery. The ruling has three parts and each has a
different reason, so they can be re-opened separately or not at all.

### 1. Chrome only. Content that is read sits on a solid surface

Glassmorphism is applied to the **rail, the top bar and floating panels**, over the controlled
gradient this product owns. It is refused on **anything a person reads to make a decision** - the
grid card, the tally, the amber notices - which sit on a solid surface.

**Source**: Setproduct's 2026 glassmorphism guide rules the effect out as a layout foundation and
in as an accent on chrome over a controlled gradient. The gradient being *controlled* is the whole
condition: translucency is only computable when you own what is behind it. **Apple's Liquid Glass
is the counter-example, not the precedent** - it failed Apple's own usability testing and is still
being reworked through the iOS 27 beta, which is what a foundation made of glass costs.

This is the same conclusion `design-system.md` §6 reached from a different direction - never
behind a form field, because a path is checked character by character - and the two now agree in
writing rather than by coincidence.

### 2. Built WITHOUT `backdrop-filter`, because WebKit reports it and does not paint it

`(ake)`, measured: WebKit answers `true` to `@supports (backdrop-filter: blur(1px))` and paints
nothing, so the feature query is a guard that cannot fire. Corroborated outside this project by
block/buzz PR #3533 and Tauri #2976 and #2827 - the same gap, found independently by three
codebases. **`filter: blur()` DOES work in WebKit**; it is the *backdrop* variant that is missing.

**The technique is the pre-2022 one**, and it is what `--glass-bg`, `--glass-border` and
`--glass-shadow` already encode:

- layered translucency, as a real colour rather than as a filter result;
- a hairline gradient border, via `background-clip`;
- an inner highlight;
- a soft shadow;
- and where a real blur is wanted, **a blurred copy of the gradient placed behind the panel**,
  which is `filter: blur()` on an element and therefore paints everywhere, rather than a filter on
  the backdrop.

⚠ **THE ADDITIVE READING IS THE BINDING ONE, ruled 2026-09-06.** "Built without
`backdrop-filter`" means the surface must be **complete, legible and correct with
`backdrop-filter` doing nothing** - §5's sentence, unchanged - and NOT that the property may not
appear. It may remain as a progressive enhancement on chrome that already stands without it.

⚠ **THIS SECTION IS NOT RETROACTIVE. IT BINDS NEW SURFACES.** ⚠ **THIS SAID "the two declarations … `.modal-backdrop` and `.panel`" UNTIL 2026-09-12, AND THERE
IS ONLY ONE.** `.panel` carries no `backdrop-filter` at all; the single pair lives in
`app.css`'s `.modal-backdrop` rule. Count it rather than trusting this line -
`grep -cE '^\s*(-webkit-)?backdrop-filter:' packages/truestill-app/src/truestill_app/static/app.css`
answers **2**, which is the `-webkit-` prefix and the standard property of one declaration. That
one **complies and is not deleted**, because it carries a real `--glass-bg` that stands alone and
the filter only adds to it. The literal reading would
have put the tree in violation of a rule on the day that rule was written, which is not what was
decided. A NEW surface is judged by the three tests above: chrome rather than content, complete
without the filter, and not supplied by a library.

### 3. No glassmorphism library, generator or component may be adopted

Checked 2026-09-06: **shadcn.io's glass navbar, superdesign.dev's generator and every
glassmorphism library examined emit `backdrop-filter`.** That is not a detail to patch after
installing - it is the whole implementation, and on the engine this product must support it
renders nothing. **None may be adopted**, and the refusal is recorded here rather than left to be
rediscovered, which is exactly what `D12` says about Aceternity.

## D16. The free tier is a volume cap. A lapsed licence loses nothing. Enforcement is a speed bump.

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-09-11).** Supersedes the parts of **D6 §3** and **D6 §4** that
left the free/Pro split an open question, and confirmed **D6 §1**'s perpetual-fallback *property*
(the pay-once commercial wording of that section is **superseded by `D18`**, 2026-09-14). It
exists because a licensing design pass found three places where the tree contradicted itself or
was about to, and a system cannot be built against a contradiction.

**What prompted it.** A design turn on the one decided-but-unbuilt system (D5) was asked to quote
its constraints from the tree rather than from conversation. Doing that surfaced three conflicts,
two of them between a proposed shape and what D6 already said. This decision rules on all three.

### 1. The free tier is a VOLUME CAP, not a feature lock

**The app always opens. Every feature works. Every screen is reachable.** What the free tier
limits is the number of files an organize run **writes** - cumulative across every run, never per
run.

**Cumulative, and the distinction is the whole decision.** A per-run cap is not a cap: a user runs
it n times and the free tier is the entire product. A cumulative cap is a lifetime budget against
the one-time job D6 §4 already identified as what this product is.

**This is the fourth candidate in D6 §4, chosen.** That section recorded it from market
observation - *"meter by RATE, not by feature... the core works completely and only volume is
limited"* - and noted it is *"compatible with the boundary below in a way feature-gating is not"*.
It is now the answer rather than a candidate.

**It keeps both of D6's rules true rather than bending them:**

- **D6 §3 stands.** *"never withholds function to force the question"*, and *"what is never done:
  a nag on launch, a countdown, a modal that must be dismissed, a degraded free experience, or any
  feature that stops working to make a point."* Nothing here stops working. There is no nag, no
  countdown and no modal. A capability present at file 1 is present at file 100,000; what changes
  is how many files the tool will write for free.
- **D6 §4's boundary stands.** *"do not cripple the core organiser"*, and **nothing behind the
  paywall stands between a user and their own files** - the cap governs only what truestill
  **writes**, so reading, finding, browsing, exporting and retrieving are untouched at any count.

⚠ **THE EARLIER PROPOSAL - "no licence means the app does nothing", the DBeaver shape - IS
REFUSED, and is recorded because it was seriously considered.** It is the direct negation of all
three sentences quoted above, and it would have made the first thing a new user meets a locked
door, for a tool whose entire proposition is custody.

**Starting number: 1,000 files**, and it is deliberately set low.

> **Raising a cap later is a gift. Lowering one is Evernote.** In 2023 Evernote cut its free tier
> from 100,000 notes to **50**, and took immediate and lasting public damage for it. A number set
> generously and corrected downward costs more reputation than the revenue it recovers, and this
> product sells trust. So the number starts low, where every later move is upward.

The figure is a starting point, not a derivation, and D6 §4's instrument applies to it unchanged:
the soak and real users decide what it should be.

### 2. A lapsed licence loses nothing it bought

**The property stands; the commercial sentence that carried it does not.** D16 quoted D6 §1's
*"Pay once, own that version forever"* - that pay-once wording is **superseded by `D18`
(2026-09-14)**. What D16 ruled, and what D18 keeps: a lapsed entitlement **never expires and never
stops working** on the build already paid for. What lapses is entitlement to **new versions** -
never any function of that build.

**There is no read-only degraded mode, and no lapsed state that cannot organize.**

⚠ **WITHDRAWN, and recorded as withdrawn rather than quietly dropped: the maintainer's own earlier
framing that a lapsed licence "still opens, finds, browses and exports, but does not organize".**
It was wrong on the perpetual-fallback property's own terms. Organizing is the core function, so a
licence that cannot organize **is** a licence that stopped working, which is the exact sentence
that property forbids. It is written down because a withdrawn position that leaves no trace gets
re-proposed.

Consequence for the design, and it is load-bearing: the entitlement carried by a token is a
**version ceiling** checked against the running build, never a date checked against the system
clock. A build is covered or it is not, and that answer is identical on a machine whose clock is
wrong - which removes the whole clock-tampering problem rather than defending against it. **D18
notes that a subscription raises that ceiling yearly instead of once - the architecture already
supports it.**

### 3. Enforcement is a speed bump, not a wall

**Recorded in writing so that nobody builds a fortress later.**

The cap is counted locally. A local counter can be reset by deleting the catalog or reinstalling,
and that is not a defect awaiting a fix - **enforcing it properly requires asking the server,
which D5 forbids**: *"there is no per-launch phone-home and no periodic revalidation."* The two
cannot both be had, and D5 is the one that ships.

**So the cap is for honest people.** That is the same bet D6 §2 already made and gave the reason
for - *"a social deterrent rather than a technical restriction, which is deliberate: it costs an
honest user nothing, and it never risks locking out someone who has paid."* The trade is recorded
here rather than discovered by whoever later notices the counter is resettable and starts
hardening it. **Hardening it is the refused direction**, because every mechanism that makes the
count harder to reset makes it likelier to strand someone who paid.

### 4. How each of the three above is actually enforced (2026-09-11, later the same day)

Written after stage 1 was built, because building it surfaced four questions §1-§3 did not
answer. Each is ruled here rather than left to whoever writes the UI.

**A build a token does not cover is never INSTALLED, not refused at runtime.**

This is the answer to §2, and it is what makes §2 true in practice rather than only on paper. The
build a customer paid for runs for ever, untouched. What lapses is *receiving the next one*, and
that is enforced by **not shipping it to them** - never by a newer build declining to start.

⚠ **The reason, and it is the whole of D16 in one sentence: if a newer build refused to run, an
automatic update would strand a paying customer behind a gate.** They would go to bed with a
working photo organiser and wake up to a licence screen, having done nothing and bought
everything. That is precisely the failure this decision exists to prevent, arriving through the
back door of a feature nobody thinks of as commercial.

**So: nothing in the product may auto-update across an epoch boundary.** Not the app, not an
installer, not a package manager path we control. A user may always choose to install a build
their licence does not cover - that is their machine - but the product may never make that choice
for them.

Where the rule lives so the release process meets it: the banner at the top of
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which is what a person reads before dispatching a release.

**The counter lives with the token, not in the catalog.**

`app_paths.allowance_path`, beside `licence.token` in the data directory. The argument is the
same one that placed the token, run in the other direction: **a catalog travels when it is
copied**, so a counter living there would carry the cap to a second machine - punishing exactly
the multi-drive, multi-library behaviour this product is *for*. A catalog rebuild resetting the
count is acceptable under §3; travelling is not, and the asymmetry is deliberate.

It counts **files an organize run writes**, cumulative across every run. Not files scanned, not
files previewed, not files in a library.

**At the cap, the run is refused before it starts. It is never stopped part-way.**

Half an organize run is the worst state this product can leave a library in: some files moved,
some not, and a user who cannot tell which. The promise is that a run either happens or does not.

This is only possible because **the preview already knows `will_organize`**, so the question is
asked before the first byte moves. The refusal names the number the run would write and the
number that remains, and says that nothing has moved - a refusal that does not say so sends the
user to go and check their library, which is the same anxiety in a different shape.

If `will_organize` exceeds what remains, the run does not start. There is no partial organize.

**Bumping `BUILD_EPOCH` is a commercial act and gets a release checklist.**

An epoch is opened by **adding a row to `licence.EPOCH_OPENED_AT`**, never by editing the
integer, and **only by a minor or major release - never a patch**. A patch is the release nobody
reads the diff of twice; requiring a minor bump means the version number itself announces to
every customer that something commercial happened.

Two guards, because the checkout and the artifact are different questions.
`test_the_entitlement_epoch_cannot_move_by_accident.py` holds the tree honest in `make check`,
which cannot be skipped by dispatching a workflow with the wrong inputs.
`packaging/compare_selfcheck.py` holds the *binary* honest, by reading the epoch out of the
frozen build's own self-check and comparing it against the tree - the existing
artifact-versus-checkout machinery, extended rather than duplicated, because a binary carrying
the wrong epoch is exactly `(ajw)`'s class: a fact about the build that nothing compared, and a
product that works perfectly while being commercially wrong.

### 5. What the user is told, and when (2026-09-11, third pass)

Five rulings, made after the cap was built, because building it made clear that *having* a
correct answer and *saying* it well are different problems. Each is a decision about the moment
of contact, and four of them are about **not** saying something.

**The check runs at Apply, never live.**

The preview stays complete and **silent about the cap**. The refusal appears when the user asks
for the run - once, with both numbers, before anything moves.

⚠ **A number that updates as the user types is a countdown, and D6 §3 forbids countdowns** by
name. A remaining-files figure ticking down beside a form is the most effective sales pressure
available and it is exactly the thing this product promised not to build. It would also be
*wrong* half the time, because a preview is re-run on every change.

**The licence problem outranks the cap. One message at a time.**

A user can have two true problems at once - a token that will not verify, and a run over the free
allowance. **These are not independent**: `allowance.remaining_for` cannot treat an unverifiable
token as an entitlement, because it has no way to tell one from no token at all. So a customer
whose file was truncated by a sync client is, by the arithmetic, capped.

⚠ **Lead with the cap and they are told to buy a thing they already own.** An unreadable token is
a thing the user can fix and must know about; the cap is a thing they chose by using the product.
`licence_notice.notice_for` is the one place that decides, and a licence notice comes in two
forms - blocking and not - because a damaged file on someone well inside the allowance must be
said without stopping their work.

**The remaining allowance is shown where the account is, always, and nowhere else.**

Not beside the form, not beside the run button, and **not "when it gets low"** - that last one is
a countdown wearing a different hat, and it is the version a well-meaning person will propose.

A user who wants to know looks at their account, where it is always visible and never moves. A
user who does not never meets it until Apply. This is what makes the Apply-time refusal legible
rather than a surprise: the number was never hidden, it was simply never pushed.

**And a non-blocking licence notice goes to the same place** (ruled 2026-09-11, closing the last
open question this section had). Not a banner, not a toast, not near the form. It is the user's
relationship with their licence and **that relationship has one home**; a damaged token announced
across the top of whatever screen happens to be open is the interruption D6 §3 forbids, and it
would also be the second place a licence is discussed, which is how two surfaces start
contradicting each other. The account slot says it, the user opens the account when they want to
deal with it, and nothing stops working meanwhile.

**The free tier is announced before download. Launch requirement, not code.**

The download page says what the free tier is, in the same plain words D9 already requires for the
SmartScreen warning.

⚠ **A cap discovered at file 1,001 reads as a trick, and D6 §3's whole subject is not tricking
people.** The ruling above keeps the number out of the interface; that only works if the number
was stated before the download. Stated up front it is a published limit; discovered at the point
of refusal it is a bait-and-switch, and the two are the same number.

**The website does not exist**, so this is recorded as a launch requirement blocking monetization
- alongside `(afg)`'s download page, not as work with code attached.

⚠ **This sentence named a third co-blocker, *"the attorney trademark clearance"*, until 2026-09-16,
and cited it as `PROJECT_STATUS.md:604` - a line number that had already drifted to 613.** The gate
itself is gone (**D21**: the name proceeds, no clearance is sought, the risk is accepted rather than
eliminated), so what blocks monetization here is the download page and this announcement on it.

**FILE-IMPORT IS THE FALLBACK, NOT THE FRONT DOOR** (ruled 2026-09-11, third pass).

What is built today is file-import: the user types or pastes a **path** to the licence file they
downloaded. That is D5's offline path and it stays. **It is not the primary route.**

⚠ **The reason is who this product is for.** truestill's users are not developers. A person who
has just paid for a photo organiser may not know where their downloads folder is, what a path is,
or that the file they were sent is the thing the box is asking for. A route that requires all
three is a route that generates support mail from people who have already given you money.

**The stage-4 primary path is paste-a-key or sign-in**, and the file route is kept beside it,
relabelled as the offline one.

**The precedent, checked rather than recalled** - JetBrains does exactly this and ships both in
one dialog. Its documentation describes pasting *"the activation code into the License Key
field"*, and beside that field a **"..." button** that points at *"the activation code file"*,
with drag-and-drop onto the same field as a third way in. The offline code is labelled *"for
offline usage"*: the file is the fallback, named as such, and never the thing a normal customer
meets first.

⚠ **The usability half is a NULL RESULT and is recorded as one.** A search for UX research
comparing paste-a-key against import-a-file for non-technical users returned vendor
documentation and licensing-SDK marketing, no study. So this ruling rests on the JetBrains
precedent, which is concrete, and on the maintainer's judgement about this audience - not on
evidence that does not exist.

**Nothing built is discarded**, and no code attaches to the primary path yet: pasting a key is
the same verifier reading the same token from a text box instead of a file, and signing in needs
the server that does not exist. `licence.install_token_from` is the offline half of stage 4,
arriving early.

**The CLI gets exit code `9`.**

A refused run is its own family, because a caller acts differently from every other code: `5` and
`8` mean wait, `7` means run `rescan`, `3` means install something, and `9` means **the work is
still there and no amount of retrying will do it** - stop looping and tell a person. Allocated in
`truestill_cli.cli` beside the others, with the reason, and `9` never means a partial run.

### 6. Two corrections made in the same commit

- ⚠ **D6 §2 still described key-with-no-server and read as current.** D5 §3 superseded that
  mechanism on 2026-07-28 - *"the offline-verified-key mechanism described there becomes
  token-after-activation rather than key-with-no-server"* - but §2 carried no note saying so, so
  anyone reading D6 would have quoted a retired design. §2 now points at D5 §3. What survives the
  change is its **payload** decision: Ed25519, buyer's name and email embedded, deterrence by
  identity rather than by lockout.
- ⚠ **`DECISIONS.md` said `truestill.app` was *"not yet registered"*.** `(afg)` records the
  maintainer stating on 2026-08-22 that the domain is bought, and `(afg)` itself flagged the
  contradiction on 2026-09-02 and left it for the maintainer to resolve. Resolved here: it is
  registered, and the line is corrected.

### 7. RECOVERING YOUR OWN PHOTOGRAPHS IS NEVER CAPPED (2026-09-11, restore stage 2)

**`truestill recover` does not consult the allowance and does not charge it.** It copies files
into a library - the one operation §1 says the cap governs - and it is exempt.

**Why, and the reason is the whole of it: recovering your own photographs from your own backup is
not organizing.** The cap in §1 is a price for *work truestill does for you* - deciding where a
photograph belongs, renaming it, de-duplicating it, building a library out of a heap. A recover
does none of that. It copies bytes the user already owns, back to paths **truestill itself chose
on an earlier run that was already paid for or already counted**. Charging for it would bill the
same files twice: once when they were organized, again when a disk died.

⚠ **And the moment it would fire is the worst moment in the product.** A person runs this having
just lost a library. The answer *"you have reached your free limit, please buy a licence to get
your photographs back"* is the definition of holding data hostage - it is D6 §4's boundary, *"do
not cripple the core organiser"*, failing at the one point where the user has no alternative and
no leverage. D6 §3 forbids withholding function to force the question; there is no version of
this that is not exactly that.

**It is also the rule D6 §4 already states, applied where it bites hardest**: *"nothing behind the
paywall stands between a user and their own files"*, and §1 restates it - *"reading, finding,
browsing, exporting and **retrieving** are untouched at any count"*. A recover is retrieval. The
word was already there; this section is only naming the command it now has.

**What this does NOT license.** The exemption is for copying a file back to the path the catalog
already records for it. It is not a route around the cap:

- A recover **cannot create a library**. It refuses unless both sides are registered drives, and
  a drive nobody has walked has no rows to recover from.
- It **never re-derives layout**. Paths come from `file_copies`, so nothing is being organized -
  which is exactly why there is nothing to charge for.
- **`organize` is unchanged and still charged.** Ingesting new photographs is the work, and the
  work is what the cap prices.

**Where it is enforced:** nowhere, and deliberately. `truestill_core.recover` does not import
`allowance` at all, so there is no check to get wrong and no counter to forget to skip. The
absence is the mechanism.

⚠ **The open half, stated rather than left to be discovered.** Nothing currently stops somebody
using `backup` then `recover` as an uncapped copy tool between two registered drives. That is
accepted: it requires two drives, a walked catalog, and more effort than organizing, and D16 §3
already ruled that enforcement is **a speed bump, not a wall** - *"someone determined to avoid
paying will avoid paying"*. If it is ever observed in the field it is a §3 question, not a reason
to cap retrieval.

**Status:** Settled as a decision, partially built. Supersedes D6 §3's and §4's open free/Pro
split with the volume cap; confirms the perpetual-fallback property (now carried by **D18** rather
than by D6 §1's pay-once wording) and withdraws the lapsed-read-only framing; records the
enforcement trade. **Built:** the token format and its verifier, the cumulative
counter, the cap as a pure function, the precedence between a licence problem and the cap, the
epoch's two guards, exit code `9`, and §7's exemption for `recover`. **Not built:** the
licensing server and payment - activation against a remote that does not exist yet. **Built on
the client:** the Account screen, `/api/account*` routes, and the rail's account slot
(`renderAccount`). §5's free-tier announcement is a **website** deliverable and the website
does not exist.

### 8. A LICENSED RUN DOES NOT CHARGE THE FREE COUNTER (2026-09-15, `(akq)`)

**A clarification of §1, not a change to it.** `record_files_written` was unconditional, so every
applied organize run drew down the free allowance whether or not an entitlement had paid for it.

⚠ **Found by using the product, and the consequence was measured on a real install.** One licensed
run over a 2,574-file library took the counter from **844 to 3,418**. Nothing was visibly wrong at
the time - an entitled install never reads the counter - but the moment that token file is lost or
signed out, the fallback is *"0 of 1,000 left"*: **worse off than someone who had just downloaded
truestill**, at exactly the moment they are already in trouble and least able to cope with it.

**§1's *"cumulative across every run"* is what was misread, and the misreading was mine to correct
rather than to obey.** That sentence exists to close one hole and says so in its own words: *"A
per-run cap is not a cap: a user runs it n times and the free tier is the entire product."* It is
an argument about **the free tier's** arithmetic. It was never an argument for billing a licence
holder against a limit that does not apply to them, and reading it that way turns a rule protecting
the business into one that punishes the customer.

**Ruled: the counter records what this install wrote WHILE ON THE FREE TIER.** An entitled run
writes files; it does not spend an allowance, because it has none to spend.

- **`ACTIVE` and `LAPSED` do not charge.** Lapsed is included by §2 - *"a lapsed licence loses
  nothing it bought"* - and charging it would hand someone who paid a smaller free tier than
  someone who never did.
- **`UNREADABLE` still charges**, by `remaining_for`'s existing asymmetry: a token that will not
  verify cannot be told from no token, so it cannot be the basis of an entitlement.
- **The test is `remaining_for`, never a list of states**, so "entitled" has one definition and a
  sixth state cannot disagree with it.

⚠ **THE COUNTER IS NOT RESET WHEN A LICENCE IS INSTALLED, and that is deliberate.** What a user
wrote on the free tier is a fact, and it survives a purchase. What changes is that nothing is added
to it while the entitlement stands.

⚠ **What happens to the 3,418 already on the maintainer's install.** It is defect residue and test
noise, not usage: the value before this work began was **161**, and everything above that is a
licensed run plus walkthrough runs made while proving the cap. It is corrected to **161** - his
genuine free-tier usage - by the documented means §3 already names, *"deleting it, or editing it to
zero, restores the full allowance"*. **Correcting it is not a special entitlement**: any user whose
counter was inflated by this defect may do the same, and the file is plain JSON precisely so they
can.

---

## D17. Import applies in the app too, and it means "into this destination"

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-09-11).** Two rulings on the Import surface, made because the
product could show a user exactly what an import would do and could not do it.

### 1. The app applies. Its absence was drift, not a decision.

**`truestill ingest --apply` already organizes** - `cli.py:_cmd_ingest` runs the ordinary pipeline
(`_run_pipeline`, passing `takeout=scan.sidecars`) and calls `execute(apply=args.apply)`. The
engine was never missing. What was missing when this was written was one service function and one
route: there was no `/api/ingest/run` (`server.py` carried three ingest routes - `preview`,
`archives/precheck`, `archives/run`), and `service/takeout.py:archive_ingest_run` unpacked,
recorded the extraction, and then **ended in a preview**.

⚠ **BOTH SHIPPED 2026-09-11, AND THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE PREMISE RATHER THAN THE STATE.**
`service/organize.ingest_run` is `organize_run` with `takeout=` set, behind `/api/ingest/run` and
a typed confirm. Count the routes rather than reading this line:
`grep -c 'api/ingest' packages/truestill-app/src/truestill_app/server.py` answers **4**.

⚠ **THE ABSENCE OF A REASON IS THE EVIDENCE, and it is the project's own rule that makes it so.**
`BACKLOG.md`'s *App-surface deferrals* register exists precisely to stop a single-surface contract
being implicit: *"an undocumented single-surface contract is indistinguishable from drift."* It
names five members - `(aap)`, the date rescue, trip/event naming, `reclaim`, `{camera_model}` -
and **ingest-apply is not among them**. No `D`-number mentions it. `(jj)`, `(agg)`, `(aht)` and
`(akg)` are about other things. So this was never ruled on; it was left.

**Ruled: the app applies.** This decision is the record that was missing, and it is recorded as
**drift corrected**, not as a deferral ending.

### 2. Import means INTO THIS DESTINATION

`(akg)` left this open - *"whether Import means 'bring these into this destination' … or 'bring
these into the library'"* - and named the CLI as the reference without reading it.

**The CLI was read, and then run.** `_run_pipeline` passes
`on_destination=_shas_on_destination(...)` into `resolve`, so `ingest` has always scoped dedup to
the destination. Measured on a two-drive fixture: six photographs ingested into Drive A, then the
**same source** ingested into a fresh Drive B - `skipped (exact dup): 0`, and **Drive B received
all six**.

So the ruling matches what the CLI already does, and `(akg)`'s question is answered by the
reference it nominated. This is `(aei)` on a third surface.

⚠ **And the app disagrees with it today.** `service/takeout.py:ingest_preview` resolves
catalog-globally and passes no `on_destination`, so on the identical fixture it promises
**`kept: 0`, `dup_collapsed: 6`** for a fresh drive the CLI fills. That is defect **D2** of
`handoff-2026-09-05.md` - *"no second copy"* - on Import.

**The fix is D14's shape and not the one-argument version**, which that record measured and
rejected: scoping the single `resolve` makes the promise true and empties the naming. One pass,
catalog-global, then `promise_view` re-judges against this destination with the run's own
function. Both rulings then hold at once.

### What this decision does NOT settle

- **The staging tree's lifetime.** `(aht)` - `clear_staging` has no caller - is untouched and
  still wants its own ruling.
- **The dry-run-extracts-anyway shape.** `_source_root_or_none` unpacks before any `--apply`
  check and therefore under no drive lock. Named here so it is not rediscovered; not ruled on.
- **`--tz`, `--prefer-takeout-dates`, `--map-albums`**, which `cli-app-parity.md` records as
  unimplemented in the app.

**Status:** Settled as a decision, and built except for the flags. **Built:** the
destination-scoped promise on both Import previews (2026-09-11), then the apply route
`/api/ingest/run` and the screen's typed confirm the same day, then the completion card's counts.
**Not built:** `--tz`, `--prefer-takeout-dates` and `--map-albums`, which is what
`cli-app-parity.md`'s ingest row also says. ⚠ **This read "Not built: the apply route, the
screen's control, or the three flags" until 2026-09-13**, two days after the first two shipped -
a status line that contradicted the parity table it shares a subject with.

---

## D18. Yearly subscription with a perpetual fallback. $59/year, annual only.

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-09-14).** Supersedes **D6 §1**'s pay-once commercial shape
(*"Pay once, own that version forever"* / one-time purchase with optional renewal for updates).
Keeps the property D6 §1 and D16 §2 already ruled: **a lapsed entitlement still works** on the
build last paid for. What lapses is entitlement to **new versions**, never access to the library
or to any function of that build.

### 1. The model (JetBrains' shape, named as the precedent)

**While subscribed: everything.** Stop paying: the app keeps working forever on the **version
last paid for**. It opens, organizes, finds, exports. What lapses is new versions.

This is JetBrains' commercial model applied to a custody tool: yearly billing for continued
value, with a perpetual fallback so cancellation never becomes lockout. The token architecture
already supports it - D16 §2 made ``covers_through`` a **version ceiling**, not a date; a
subscription raises that ceiling yearly instead of once.

### 2. Price: 59 USD per year

**The reasoning matters more than the number.** Forum research on Adobe shows the anger is about
**lockout**, not price. *"If we cancel the plan does it have lockout software on it"* - and it
does. *"Whatever happened to the good old days where you could buy software and own it forever."*
Meanwhile the same research has a photographer calling $120/year *"a good price"*. People accept
paying yearly for continued value; they hate losing access to what they have already paid for.
The perpetual fallback removes the only complaint that actually appears.

⚠ **NULL RESULT, recorded rather than papered over:** there is **no forum evidence** on what
people pay for a **custody** tool, because no such product exists. The *model* is evidence-backed;
the *number* is judgement, and the first ten customers settle it.

⚠ **WHY 59 RATHER THAN LOWER:** raising a price on existing customers is the Evernote and VMware
story already in this project's research. Set it where it can come down.

### 3. Annual only. No monthly option.

Organizing is a one-time job, so a monthly price lets someone pay once, organize their whole
library over a weekend, and cancel - the free-tier problem again, on the paid tier. Annual
billing matches what is being sold: a **year of custody**, not one afternoon of sorting. If
monthly is ever added it must carry the usual premium so annual is obviously the better choice.

### 4. What does NOT change

- **D16 §7** - `recover` is never capped.
- **The free allowance** - D16 §1's volume cap and starting number.
- **``covers_through`` as a version ceiling** - a subscription raises it yearly; no clock check,
  no new token shape required for the commercial change.

**Status:** Settled as a decision, unbuilt on the commercial side. The verifier and the version
ceiling already exist (D5 / D16). Licensing server, payment, and any screen that sells or renews
do not.

## D19. The canvas is warm again. `#faf8f5` → `#f1ebe1` → `#e8e9f3`.

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-09-14).** Supersedes the **2026-09-06 white-canvas ruling** that
overruled `design-system.md` §1 and collapsed `--canvas-from`, `--canvas-mid` and `--canvas-to`
to `#ffffff`.

### Why

Glass on a white canvas reads as a soft panel, because glass needs something behind it. Flat
white made light-mode glass arithmetic-invisible (white fill over `#ffffff` composites to white).
Plus the 2026 *"elevated neutrals"* argument: stark white clashes with dark mode.

The warm gradient restores tonal range for translucency **against**, without making every surface
glass - D15 still confines glass to chrome; form cards stay solid.

### The values

```css
--canvas-from: #faf8f5;
--canvas-mid:  #f1ebe1;
--canvas-to:   #e8e9f3;
```

These are the stops `design-system.md` §1 originally specified. The white overrule is reversed;
the section below them in that document is current again.

**Status:** Settled as a decision. Tokens already carry these values; the living specification is
corrected to match.

## D20. The rail is rose-charcoal `#161014`.

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-09-14).** Records the rail ground chosen 2026-09-13 and measured
in `app.css`: `--rail-bg: #161014`. Supersedes living claims that the rail is near-black
`#17150f` or cool `#101012` as the current colour.

### Why

Chosen to **relate to the rose mark** rather than fight it - near-black with a rose undertone, so
the rail is not a detached cool slab beside a warm canvas. `--rail-accent` measures **9.93:1**
against this ground (`#fda4af` on `#161014`); every other `--rail-*` ratio in the block is
re-derived against the same hex and pinned by `test_the_rail_contrast_is_what_it_says.py`.

**Status:** Settled as a decision, built. The hex is already in `app.css`; living docs that still
named `#17150f` or `#101012` as current are corrected.

## D21. Truestill proceeds under its own name, to monetization. No attorney clearance is sought.

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-09-16).** Supersedes the standing **pre-monetization obligation**
recorded in `PROJECT_STATUS.md` §1 since 2026-07-26 - *"attorney clearance is still required before
monetization"* - and the same gate where D16 §5 and `(afg)` name it as a co-blocker.

**The risk is accepted, not eliminated.** Those are the words, and they are the whole of the
decision's honesty: nothing below makes the residual go away, and no opinion has been bought. What
changed is who carries it and whether it stops a release.

### 1. The residual, as it actually stands on the public register

⚠ **The repository said *"full analysis in `DECISIONS.md`"* and there was no analysis here.** The
five-gate availability check of 2026-07-26 - PyPI, GitHub, npm, USPTO **and** EUIPO/TMview, and a
web-presence scan, with both trademark negatives validated by a control query - lived in
`PROJECT_STATUS.md` and was deleted by `99a6d5b` (2026-07-30, *"consolidate onboarding status
docs"*, -519 lines). `e66ff63` restored a **three-line summary** pointing at this file, where the
analysis had never been put. So for 48 days the only copy of the reasoning was in `git show
f6dfcb3`. This section is that reasoning re-established from the register itself, not copied
forward.

**Checked 2026-09-16 against `tmsearch.uspto.gov`'s own search service** (the public register, no
key, no fee; the index's newest `recordLoadDate` was **2026-09-15**, so the data was one day old).
Reproducible:

```sh
curl -s -X POST https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/prod-stage-v1-0-0/tmsearch \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"size":30,"query":{"match_phrase":{"wordmark":"TRUESTILL"}}}'
```

**TRUESTILL: zero records.** Exact phrase on `wordmark`, and zero again across
`wordmark`/`wordmarkAsciiRepresentation`/`wordmarkPseudoText`/`ownerFullText` together; `TRUE
STILL` and `TRU STILL` are also zero. ⚠ **The negative is validated by a control**, the same
discipline the 2026-07-26 check used: `LIGHTROOM` returns 3, Adobe's live IC 009 among them, so the
query reaches real data and an empty answer means empty.

**TRUSTILE: 26 records, 13 live, owned by TruStile Doors, LLC.** Live classes **IC 019** (non-metal
and wood doors), **IC 035** (online wholesale door retail) and **IC 040** (manufacture of doors to
order). An active, maintained portfolio - and **two brand-new `TRUSTILE` applications were filed
2026-06-09** (serials 99874648, 99874659), not yet assigned to an examiner, adding IC 035 and IC
040. They are doors: *"online wholesale store services featuring doors"*, *"computerized online
ordering services … in the field of doors."*

⚠ **AND THE OLD RECORD WAS WRONG ABOUT ONE THING, which is the point of looking.** It said their
live marks carry *"no software or SaaS class"*. They carry one: **`TRUCAD`, serial 77331383, IC 042
LIVE** - *"providing temporary use of on-line non-downloadable software for selecting doors and
door styles."* Its IC 009 half is cancelled, and the earlier `TRU CAD` (76143128, IC 009,
*"computer software for use in selecting doors and door styles"*) was cancelled in 2008.

**This slightly increases the residual and does not change the ruling.** It is a **different mark**
(`TRUCAD`, not `TRUSTILE`) and the goods are door-selection software sold to people buying doors -
so it is evidence that this filer reaches for IC 042 when it wants to, not evidence of a conflict
with a consumer photo organizer. It is recorded because a ruling built on a fact nobody re-checked
is the failure this repository keeps finding, and because it makes one of the falsifiers below
concrete rather than hypothetical.

### 2. The reasoning - recorded as reasoning, not as certainty

**None of this is legal advice, and none of it was obtained from a lawyer.** It is the reading the
maintainer is acting on, written down so a later reader can judge it rather than inherit it.

- **The legal test is LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION, not name similarity.** Public sources put it
  plainly: *"totally unrelated - if the businesses are in entirely separate realms, confusion is
  unlikely. Using the same name for a coffee shop and a computer software company usually wouldn't
  confuse consumers, because people do not expect those very different goods or services to come
  from the same source."*
- **The precedent everyone cites:** *Delta*, shared by a major airline and a faucet manufacturer.
- **The one exception, and why it does not apply:** marks in different classes conflict when the
  products *"are sold in the same marketing channels"*. Doors and photo software share no shop, no
  shelf and no advertising. A person specifying interior doors and a person sorting a Takeout
  export are not in the same aisle, and nothing Truestill does would put it there.
- **The spellings differ:** *TruStile*, *Truestill*. Not identical, and *stile* / *still* are not
  homophones - a stile is the vertical member of a door frame, and the door company's name says so.
- **And the maintainer's own, which is a cost judgement rather than a legal one:** paying for
  clearance on a residual this remote is not a cost this project can carry. That is the real reason
  the gate is going, and it is stated as such rather than dressed as confidence.

### 3. ⚠ WHAT WOULD CHANGE IT - because a ruling with no falsifier is a hope

| trigger | what it means | what happens |
|---|---|---|
| **A letter arrives** - cease-and-desist, opposition, or a USPTO refusal citing TRUSTILE | The residual has stopped being a residual. Nothing above was ever a prediction that no one would write | **Stop and get an attorney.** This decision buys no argument with a real claimant; it only says not to pre-pay for one that has not been made. Do not answer a demand letter out of §2 |
| **The other party enters software** - a `TRUSTILE`-marked product in IC 009 or IC 042 that is not about doors | The category-distance argument, which is the load-bearing one, weakens by exactly as much as the distance closes | **Re-run the register check and re-rule.** ⚠ Not hypothetical: `TRUCAD` is already live in IC 042, so this party files in software classes. What would matter is the **mark** and the **goods** moving, not the class alone |
| **Truestill enters anything near their trade** - doors, millwork, building products, architectural specification, or a channel where those are sold | The exception in §2 fires: same marketing channel is the condition under which different classes still conflict | **The ruling is void, not weakened.** This is the one trigger entirely within this project's control, and the remedy is to not do it rather than to re-argue |

**Whose job it is to watch**: nobody's, and that is stated rather than assigned. There is no
monitoring service, no docket alert and no calendar entry - a **new** `TRUSTILE` filing landed on
2026-06-09 and this project learned of it 99 days later, by running a query for the first time.
Re-running §1's command is one line and costs nothing; it is worth doing before a paid release and
before any public launch page, and nothing enforces that.

### 4. What this does NOT clear

⚠ **The attorney list had two items on it and only one is ruled.** `(aad)` records the second under
the heading *"Awaiting attorney clearance"*: the **Windows exiftool package carries a GPLv3
component**. That question is untouched by this decision - its facts are established there
(separately-invoked process, never linked; GCC Runtime Library Exception v3.1 present), and its own
reasoning is that *"very likely fine"* is not what a licence question wants when the answer arrives
after shipping. **Nothing here says to skip it**, and a reader who takes "the attorney gate is
gone" from this file and applies it to that one has misread both.

**Status:** Settled as a decision. The gate is removed from `PROJECT_STATUS.md` §1 and §2b, from
D16 §5's co-blocker list and from `(afg)`; `(aad)`'s GPLv3 item keeps its heading and gets a
pointer here. No code attaches to this.

## D22. Source licence: PolyForm Strict 1.0.0; no outside code contributions

**Decision (the maintainer, 2026-11-05).** Supersedes D7. The source in this repository is
licensed under PolyForm Strict 1.0.0. Bug reports and ideas are welcome in Issues; code
contributions are not accepted.

**Numbering:** D22, because D11 to D21 were taken.

### Context

D7 chose Apache-2.0 open-core. Apache-2.0 lets anyone sell the product, including a hosted or
repackaged copy, while the maintainer's income is the paid yearly licence (D18). The product is a
free-for-personal-use tool with paid commercial use.

### Decision

- `LICENSE` is the PolyForm Strict 1.0.0 text unchanged, with two Required Notice lines above it.
- Package metadata is `license = "LicenseRef-PolyForm-Strict-1.0.0"` with `license-files`
  (PEP 639; the licence has no SPDX identifier).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the README say: free for personal use, business use needs a commercial
  licence, issues welcome, no code contributions.

### Why

- **PolyForm Strict text.** It permits "any noncommercial purpose", which includes personal use,
  and the grant excludes "distributing the software or making changes or new works based on the
  software" (https://polyformproject.org/licenses/strict/1.0.0). That is the shape wanted:
  use freely, no forks, no resale.
- **SQLite, copyright page.** States that SQLite is open source but not open contribution
  (https://sqlite.org/copyright.html). A long-lived, widely used tool with the same policy.
- **GitHub, 2026-02-13 changelog** on pull request settings: a repository can restrict who may
  open pull requests, so the policy can be enforced rather than only written down.

### Alternatives considered

- **Keep Apache-2.0 (D7).** Lost: it allows commercial resale and hosting with no payment, which
  is the one use that costs the paid licence its customers.
- **PolyForm Noncommercial.** Lost: it permits changes and new works, so forks and
  redistribution of modified copies are allowed. Strict keeps the code as shipped.
- **All rights reserved.** Lost: no licence text at all gives users no written permission for
  personal use, and GitHub's terms then allow only viewing and forking. A standard licence says
  plainly what is free.
- **Accept pull requests with a CLA.** Lost: review and CLA administration cost maintainer time
  the rewrite plan does not have, and contributors would still expect a say in a codebase that
  is to be replaced in Rust.

### Consequences

- v0.1.0 and v0.1.1 stay Apache-2.0. Those grants are irrevocable and nothing here reaches them.
- The next release is PolyForm Strict.
- Pro features themselves stay in a private repository. This tree holds only the capability
  seam and the licence check that gate them; the check embeds one public verification key and
  no secret.
- All human commits in this repository are the owner's, so relicensing needed no one else's
  consent. That holds only while no outside code is accepted, which is why contributions are
  closed.
- The Debian copyright file and the three package `pyproject.toml` files name the new licence;
  a test keeps the three package `LICENSE` copies identical to the root.

**Status:** Settled.
